4 Ways to F Up Product Development,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/4-ways-to-f-up-product-development,"I love sharing frameworks. I love using alliteration. I love building products. Get ready.

In my view, structured product development involves planning a route and allowing for detours;  you have to iterate and innovate on multiple dimensions, in concert, to actually take advantage of market opportunity and customer demand. And on this journey, you have to measure where your product team is spending its time to ensure they‚Äôre not going in circles. There‚Äôs a simple device I like to use for this purpose‚Ä¶

The 4 F‚Äôs. Each F has a purpose:

features - take 2 steps forward

fixes - avoid taking 1 step back

foundation - (re)pave the road

future - find new/better route(s)

Catchy, right? I stole it from the

former head of engineering at Twitter

, who stole it from someone else at Salesforce. My contribution was adding an F (it was originally 3 F‚Äôs). If you‚Äôve been reading this newsletter, you know I

like to break the Rule of 3

.

A recent

Reforge blog post

on the 4 categories of product problems beyond product-market fit (PMF) reminded me of this. They use a slightly different (better articulated, less catchy) framework:

feature work (aka features)

growth work (aka fixes)

scaling work (aka foundation)

PMF expansion (aka future)

Whatever mental model you prefer, the meta-point is to measure where a product team‚Äôs output is directed and discuss whether that drives the desired outcomes.

I‚Äôd love to hear about other ways readers think about bucketing product work - please chime in via the comments feature belowüëáüèæ. Pile on even if you don‚Äôt believe in PMF, as I sometimes do

Accidentally Narrowing Your Market,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/accidentally-narrowing-your-market,"Learning from users is a tried and true technique for building viable products. In my time at Amazon, ‚Äúcustomer obsession‚Äù was a principle that was drilled into me. I came to believe that while talking to customers was not a guarantee of success, no great product was ever built without talking to customers. But is there a downside? Could you be talking to your customers too much?

This post was prompted by a comment from a podcast I listened to recently (linked below) where the host used the term ‚Äúaccidentally narrowing the market‚Äù to describe an anti-pattern product teams can fall into. Basically, over-indexing on a subset of your userbase that doesn‚Äôt represent the larger market need can lead you to over-build on the wrong dimensions and end up with a niche product.

But how can a best practice like listening to your users backfire? And what does falling into this trap look like close up?

It starts with us as product builders not being aware of the biases in our research rituals. If you think about the ways in which we gather a pool of participants, they rely on accessing people while they are in the product (think a targeted survey). And while there are many flavors of users (core, power, marginal) in your product, your filtering criteria and just the frequency of usage will pull in power users more than others.

But what‚Äôs wrong with talking to power users? They actually know your product best, right? Well, there‚Äôs a reason power users raise their hands and offer their time more than anyone else - not only are they fans of your product, but they also have a strong opinion on the purpose of your product. They have a clear perspective on your value proposition, because they have seen the ROI firsthand. But what happens when their view is too myopic? What I‚Äôm highlighting here is the tension between your current product-market fit (PMF), which your power users have zero-ed in on, vs future PMF expansion, which gets into territory where your power users don‚Äôt operate or care to.

This phenomenon is compounded by the fact that we like listening to power users - they are fans and champions after all! So while you might also have access to and learn from more basic and adjacent users, the number of times you check in with power users makes that feedback more stratified in your mind. It‚Äôs easier to lean on relationships you‚Äôve already established instead of building new ones. And when you or your product executives get enamored with an idea or a shiny object, you‚Äôll run to your power users to check the box and validate your thinking.

Now what happens if you over-build for your power user population? Quantitatively their usage probably goes up. Qualitatively their satisfaction probably goes up. Where‚Äôs the harm? We‚Äôre getting all the right types of engagement. Well, there are some side effects to over-building on a narrow set of dimensions. First, all product surface that you create has a maintenance tax. The way we justify paying that tax is amortizing it across your user base. But when you create features and capabilities for just your power users, no one else contributes to paying that tax. In fact, your more novice users might balk at being asked to pay the tax for a feature set they didn‚Äôt ask for. What this looks like in practice is you having to raise prices for all customers to justify the R&D investment or pushing add-on‚Äôs with limited attach rate potential. Ultimately, this creates positioning confusion (i.e. you get painted as the power-user-only product) that competitors can take advantage of.

Said another way, accidentally narrowing your market looks like contracting your ideal customer profile (ICP), when what you really want is to expand your ICP. When a product team expands its ICP, it fuels their flywheel - more users, more activation, more graduation, more champions. But in this anti-pattern, you actually clog up your flywheel: the pipeline is full of deals that use to close but now get disqualified, and the deals that do close take longer to deploy successfully, if at all. The net effect here is instead of growing your portion of the market (and ultimately taking over all of it or having a disproportionate share), you end up creating a narrow niche for your product.

The best way to combat this slippery slope is awareness and acknowledgement that a product team needs to juggle multiple tyes of workstreams (iterative feature work to cater to the engaged users you have AND innovative capability development to capture new swaths of emerging users). Lastly, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge that there might be moments in your product lifecycle when you actually want to over-index on a small, rabid user population: when you‚Äôre trying to find your initial PMF as a new product OR you‚Äôre playing in a category where all the budget is in a niche sub-segment.

 Add-On Features vs New Product Lines,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/add-on-features-vs-new-product-lines,"Multi-product strategy is something I spend a lot of time thinking about, both for the day job and via my various side hustles. And one of the clearest articulations of how to think about additional products is this diagram from Reforge.

A couple of quick takeaways from the visual:

one key reason to add surface area to your product is to expand product-market fit (PMF)

the 3 ways to expand PMF are (a) same product, new market (b) new product, same market, or (c) some combination of (a) and (b)

I want to talk about (b) in this post.

The adjacent product circle is very ambiguous in my experience, and this is where I‚Äôve seen many PMs get into trouble. In short, product teams sometimes get lost on whether they are building just add-on features for the current offering or truly complementary but separate new product lines. And it‚Äôs confusing because the outcomes you hope to drive (market penetration, category creation, customer mindshare) and the metrics you expect to move (revenue, retention, adoption) are the same with both types of product work.

To re-phrase the points above in a visual way‚Ä¶

You have a core product loop:

When you create add-on features, the intention is to improve one incremental step in the existing loop, and hopefully better complete and ultimately accelerate the loop:

But with a new product line, you‚Äôre actually creating a net-new loop that connects to your existing core product loop:

By the way, if you introduce new products that don‚Äôt conect at all to your core product, you‚Äôre building distinct but disjointed businesses, which is a post for another day.

So how do you know which state (add-on feature, new product) you‚Äôre actually in? some sniff test questions that I use:

Will pricing/packaging changes alone accomplish your intended shift? (if yes, smells like add-on)

Would the product sell stand-alone irrespective of whether customers buy your core offering? (if yes, smells like new product)

Can the product flywheel be initiated by the new product or is the core product the only entry-point? (if the latter, you have an add-on)

When churn / downsell happens, is it the entire product portfolio or do customer attempt to hang onto some pieces of functionality?

Do the product capabilities drive user stickiness (add-on feature) or user growth (new product line)? (think of this as depth vs breadth)

Can the core product team balance requests coherently or does it feel like being asked to make artificial trade-offs between 2 parallel priorities? (ideally new products are new teams vs asking core team to juggle)

The point of this post is not to say that add-on features are less valuable than new product lines (or vice versa), but it‚Äôs important to know which mode you‚Äôre in so you can set-up your operating model accordingly. When you organize for one model and try to execute another, the org design will work against you. Lastly, you sometimes don‚Äôt know early on where you stand - for example, you start building an add-on feature for what you think is your core persona and learn along the way that it‚Äôs a new product line for an adjacent persona - this is part of having a fluid point of view on the market and something seasoned PMs have to navigate.

note: I know this post is a bit overly conceptual and a real add-on vs stand-alone product story would make it more concrete - would love to get some example products from readers that I can do a teardown on‚Ä¶

As always, I‚Äôd also love to hear from readers about their own attempts at both add-on features and new product lines - please chime in via commentsüëá. And if you enjoyed this post, please consider subscribing.

update (based on reader insight / comment): ‚Äúanother benefit of knowing which bucket you‚Äôre in is it probably shapes the kind of discovery you focus on - in add-on you focus a lot more on how they use your product within your product and for new it‚Äôs about what they are doing outside of your product‚Äù

AI as an Unlock for B2B Pricing,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/ai-as-an-unlock-for-b2b-pricing,"I interviewed for a head of product job at a startup once where the CEO had a laundry list of items he wanted the new product leader to sort out - one of the items on the list was ‚Äúpricing‚Äù. When I asked him what needed to be addressed with regards to pricing, his answer was profound:

‚ÄúThe only thing I‚Äôve learned about B2B product pricing is that you‚Äôll get it wrong on the first try, and you‚Äôll need to iterate to get it right.‚Äù

That quote has stayed with me over the years. Pricing (and packaging) is this squishy domain between product building and customer outcomes that is shared between PM, Finance, and GTM and tends to suffer from being pulled in all directions. It can be frustrating to feel you have product market fit and a scalable GTM motion only to be hindered by the pricing and packaging being dissonant with your customer‚Äôs perception of value.

Now you‚Äôre probably wondering‚Ä¶why can‚Äôt you just change it? Because changing it inevitably solves the problem for one cohort of customers while creating problems for another. You end up with legacy plans, grandfathered customers, operational overhead, and an all-around cluster that account and success teams end up having to deal with.

One person that I had many discussions with around pricing / packaging was Aaron Levie at Box (when I worked there). One of the interesting learnings we had when I led the developer products business (which at times felt orthogonal to the core storage / collaboration business) was the perceptions / expectations of buyers changing as you got closer to ‚Äúthe path of revenue‚Äù. Said more clearly, if you‚Äôre helping an enterprise be more productive, they look to you on how to think about productivity and translate that into an atomic unit that you can price around; but if you‚Äôre in the critical path of their worklow, they are well versed in how their business makes money, and your product‚Äôs value is measured solely in terms of lift to that overall metric.

So when I saw this

recent Tweet from Aaron

, I immediately recognized how he was applying that old thought to a new idea: AI agents.

https://x.com/levie/status/1802512375939240065

Here‚Äôs the tl;dr:

per seat pricing is the dominant model in B2B SaaS

which pushes vendors towards horizontal SaaS

because you want to maximize users using your tool

AI agents unconstrain the # of people doing the job

For a second I thought he was going to propose charging a seat for each AI agent üò¨

But what‚Äôs potentially happening in the not-too-distant future is that AI will help reimagine the processes that are happening with an organization in order to accomplish the core business workflow.

Let‚Äôs look at an example from my recent session with

about

Layering AI into Your B2B Product and GTM

:

In this example, we walk through how a customer success leader might have a business objective to maintain CSAT as a metric while reducing costs by 50%. The way people are using AI today is to eliminate redundant tasks and automate repetitive work, which definitely helps with productivity. But with the evolving capabilities of AI agents, you‚Äôll start to see improvements in terms of real time, relevant responses and eventually the ability to reflect on and reframe the business goal itself. In other words, you eventually prompt your AI agent for customer service that you want to ‚Äúmaintain CSAT while reducing costs by 50%‚Äù and it tells you all the ways you might accomplish that - and through prompt iteration you can arrive at the most viable strategy for your business. One of the larger themes Anurag and I discussed in the

full video

is that the human involvement in the feedback loop is what slows down most workflows:

If you‚Äôre only thinking about AI as a tool to accelerate your existing processes, that‚Äôs a mistake. You‚Äôre falling into the trap of

using a new tool with your old mindset

. When your world view is your current job to be done, of course you‚Äôre going to think about any new tool as a productivity play. But AI opens the door to starting with the end business outcome and working backwards. And that requires unlearning what previously served your business. AI is going to unlock a second act for a lot of companies, and formalize the last act for many more. A quote from Aaron‚Äôs Tweet that drives this home:

‚ÄúAll of a sudden small businesses, under-resourced teams in large enterprises, and all new geographies begin to open to up as markets. AI will enable otherwise niche categories of software to become much larger, and already large categories of software to become even bigger.‚Äù

So how does this connect back to pricing?

Well, today, as a PM / GTM leader pitching value to a customer, your talk track looks something like this:

your company does primary job A to make money

in order to do A, you need B # of employees doing:

several secondary jobs B1, B2, B3, etc

the effort / efficiency of these sub jobs is measured as C1, C2, C3, etc

our software makes these various sub jobs X% more efficient

which leads to an overall efficiency gain of Y% across your workforce

which (insert fuzzy math) results in Z% more money

oh and let‚Äôs not talk about the costs to:

setup, configure, and deploy the software

train admins on ongoing maintenance

educate users on a new tool / process

integrate with other tools in the stack

Now imagine the ROI story in the future with an AI agent as a core / major part of your product:

your company does primary job A to make money

tell us how much more money you want to make

on what time horizon

with what constraints

here‚Äôs a blueprint - how much is that worth to you?

AI is a shortcut into the path of revenue, and a much more direct play. If you can generate tangible value, then pricing is based on a cut of value generated (most pricing today is abstracted away from business value and more oriented on the internal employee job to be done).

And why do we care about value-based pricing? Check out

this snippet

from

The Product Compass

- some of the most valuable companies in the world (Apple, Tesla) utilize this model. And it has historically eluded B2B software companies‚Ä¶until now.

I expect this trend to first show up downmarket because AI helps unconstrain ‚Äú

small businesses, under-resourced teams‚Äù

, so startups and lean teams will be more likely to adopt vs companies with large workforces who are not incentived to disrupt a functional workflow (agan, change management is hard). As we know,

tools and talent move upmarket

over time in B2B. This is what Scott Belsky is calling

the era of scaling without growing

:

As smaller companies modernize using a new AI-native stack of technology, they¬†no longer need to grow their team to scale their ambition. What a wild concept, but it will be increasingly true. Small teams will gain superpowers once limited to the world‚Äôs largest organizations. As a result, small teams will increasingly be able to run ‚Äî and compete with ‚Äî big businesses.

As

said in

our session

, ‚Äú90% of the action is in pure cost reduction‚Äù but a lot ‚Äúremains to be seen‚Äù because AI has the potential to ‚Äúeliminate jobs, transform the workflow, and change the buyer‚Äù.

tl;dr

Based on my experiences and learnings, and stitching together points of view from  B2B experts like

Aaron Levie

and

Scott Belsky

, I now have conviction that

IF

AI can get your B2B product closer to the critical-path, revenue generating workflow of your customer, then you can charge a % of the business growth you enable.

Andon Cords: When to Cancel a Product Launch,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/andon-cords-when-to-cancel-a-product,"I recently

polled

subscribers to see what topics they‚Äôd like to hear about next, and ‚Äúscrewing up product launches‚Äù was unexpectedly the top choice. Below is a recap of on the most confounding releases I‚Äôve ever been involved in (please try not to laugh out loud). Also, I want to preemptively share a counter-example of

one of my well-executed launches

, which incorporates many of the lessons learned during this episode.

One of the joys of working at Amazon (

remember my intense first week

) was the hundreds of little tools available to every employee to explore service interfaces (the result of an

architectural mandate

). Every dimension of the commerce lifecycle (catalog, inventory, pricing, orders, fulfillment, returns) had very powerful, internal admin GUIs accessible by anyone to play around with. I would sometimes just jump from wiki to wiki, perusing the tl;dr of each teams‚Äô toolchain. Certain tool names stuck with you because they were tongue-in-cheek jokes, memorable acronyms, or just unfamiliar terms. One such utility that stuck with me was the Andon Cord.

Basically, if there was an issue with an item listed on Amazon.com, anyone could ‚Äúpull‚Äù the Andon Cord (a principle borrowed from Toyota‚Äôs manufacturing process). The result was the immediate halting of the item‚Äôs sale, because something (quality, price, availability, review) was off. I really, really wanted to pull the Andon Cord someday!

Fast forward to the actual launch debacle. A peer of mine had been working on incorporating the Kindle and Audible customer experiences together for 1+ year; this was the culmination of Amazon‚Äôs

acquisition of the audiobook platform

and involved unifying the purchase of digital content on either the web or device store, turning on the ability to play audiobooks on the latest generation Kindle device, and providing an in-country specific catalog based on regional publisher agreements. The launch had been pushed several times due to various delays (UX debate, press timing, title selection) and now was planned to overlap with my colleague‚Äôs long-awaited world tour. I had been on the Kindle team a few months and was very eager to actually manage a launch (I‚Äôd shadowed a couple of major events and thought the best way to learn was to shepherd a release, even if it wasn‚Äôt a product that I‚Äôd been intimately involved with). So, we worked out a setup where he put together the launch plan and I covered while he was on vacation.

What could go wrong? Apparently, everything.

I got involved only a couple of weeks before launch, and while I understood the MVP experience and release plan, I didn‚Äôt have the tribal knowledge that comes with having dealt with all manner of product development issues from inception on. The core flow was pretty simple: buy an audiobook and make sure it plays. The key dimensions that mattered were as follows:

quality of audiobook download / playback on-device

accuracy of titles available for users in different locales

consistency between web store vs. device store purchase

The night before the go-live we ran through all scenarios with our QA team and felt good. The day of the launch we had multiple offices (Kindle in Seattle, Audible in New Jersey) join a video conference and walk through the release checklist. We had a deployment moratorium in effect to ensure there wouldn‚Äôt be any complicating variables during the rollout. Everyone had a test script (book titles, user logins, etc) and multiple devices (WiFi, 3G) handy. We started flipping switches, and within minutes would be ready to cut the press release‚Ä¶

Setback #1

As soon as one end-to-end test worked (buy an audiobook, download it, play successfully) we all loosened up. We started joking around and going off script - buying random titles, toggling WiFi on and off, trying to play books in non-English languages, etc. One person played an audiobook and the sound came out all garbled.

Everyone stopped.

It‚Äôs your device. It‚Äôs a corrupt download. It‚Äôs an encoding issue.

Did you download over 3G or WiFi? Do you have the right software build? Try it again!

Other people started having the same issue. Attempts to reproduce it were intermittent. The same folks on the same device with the same title wouldn‚Äôt be able to recreate it (they would delete and re-buy the title and everything would be fine).

The clock was ticking, and we couldn‚Äôt suss out the underlying issue, so we paused the launch.

Within hours, we figured out that new (incorrectly configured) hosts had been added to the cluster of servers that served audiobook content. One of the (new) engineers on the team heard about the launch and thought it would be good to add additional capacity for load. This person didn‚Äôt know the proper host config procedure or, more importantly, that a moratorium was in effect. Silly (but well-intentioned), and not the end of the world, so no reason to not re-try the launch that same afternoon.

Setback #2

There was relief as we started our second attempt. The first try hadn‚Äôt worked, but we knew exactly what had gone awry, and were confident because it felt like the type of issue we‚Äôd laugh about once everything was said and done.

We quickly breezed through the buy/download/play scenario, and started going through the portion of the test script where we had spoofed logins for users from different countries, just to ensure that the list of titles available for purchase was accurate. One of the folks in the room (who maintained content publisher relationships for the Kindle team but not the Audible team) noticed that the # of titles available when he set his country to Mexico was the same as his usual login (in the US). How could the exact same # of audiobooks be available for sale in both Mexico and the US?

We quickly started trying random countries (I picked Turks and Caicos in a panic) and lo and behold many of them had the same selection count as the US. We were definitely not correctly enforcing in-country content restrictions, which was both a customer promise and legal policy blunder.

To further complicate things, it was unclear whether this warranted hitting the brakes on the press release. The top 10 countries in terms of audiobook buyers were good to go. Given this was a joint venture, the Kindle and Audible teams couldn‚Äôt agree on whether we pause the launch / sort out the issue OR go ahead with comms / triage it later. Execs were looped in, egos were bruised, and the launch was halted. For the second time in a day.

It took into the wee hours of the night, but we were able to root cause the issue. We had a full audiobook catalog that included every title. We had denylists per country from publishers, that were updated periodically and enforced dynamically. So any time you were viewing the store, based on the provided (or derived) country of residence, the view would be filtered accurately. Apparently there was a bug where we hadn‚Äôt properly ingested the denylist for a bunch of countries outside of the top 10. But our test plan only ever ran through the top 10, so it had been months of staleness that no one had noticed. It was just luck that someone happened to try that scenario during the go-live. The sense was now developing that rigor was lacking, and there was a strong push to go back to the drawing board. I pushed for, and got, ‚Äúone last chance‚Äù the next day.

Setback #3

There was real tension in the room. I said something ridiculous to kick things off like ‚Äúthird time‚Äôs the charm‚Äù. It wasn‚Äôt.

We were testing various buying scenarios, and again, through serendipity, someone noticed that a particular title was priced differently than it had been the day before during launch testing.

Several people spoke up and highlighted that was a known issue. When the Amazon and Audible content stores had been integrated, reconciling item data (e.g. title description, audiobook price) was a matter of keeping 2 different catalog systems in sync. Whereas Amazon had reduced pricing change propagation latency over a decade plus (thanks to features like deal of the day), Audible had never focused on that (their differentiators were the listening experience and content selection). Someone made the argument that price increases / drops were part of commerce - if it swung lower for the customer, good timing, and if it swung higher, support would refund the difference for anyone perturbed enough to make the claim.

I didn‚Äôt have the benefit of having been in the trenches with this group for months, but I had read the

press release

around Amazon‚Äôs purchase of Audible. The same audiobooks were also sold on Apple‚Äôs iTunes store and played on iOS devices (there was an ongoing industry debate on purpose-built reading devices like the Kindle vs multi-purpose consumption devices like the iPad).

I was very uneasy at this point. I was trying to ship a product that I hadn‚Äôt masterminded, and the ridiculousness of the situation was dawning on me. I could see the figurative Andon Cord dangling, begging me to pull it. My

CXBR radar

was on high alert. I asked a question that I already knew the answer to.

‚ÄúDo we at least make sure that we‚Äôre never selling the same content on iTunes for cheaper?‚Äù

‚ÄúHmm. I don‚Äôt think we ever thought through that angle.‚Äù

I did a quick test. As feared. And then I pulled the Andon Cord.

It took months to re-architect catalog systems to ensure pricing changes did not put us in an awkward situation from a PR perspective. Audiobooks cost what they cost, and if there is ever a deal, it‚Äôs definitely available on Amazon properties, while cascading to other storefronts is secondary. It‚Äôs the same idea as a retail store honoring their online prices, but not worrying about what their products are going for on eBay. It was obvious in hindsight what the ideal customer experience should be, but it was a journey to figure it out, and not something that could have happened during a war room operating on fumes.

My teammate came back from his trip, horrified to hear the story of the triple flop, but eager to overcome the perception now plaguing the product. I didn‚Äôt get a fourth chance, but he got his first, and it was flawless. In the end, he shipped a much better product, and I like to think that it was always his to do so.

So what did I learn, and what can you take away?

retrospective learnings need to be operationalized

and

future-proofed - Amazon had perfected all manner of procedures around launch windows (e.g. deployment moratoriums) but a recently acquired company (Audible) had not been looped in

to PM a product requires honing instinct, which can‚Äôt be manufactured if you skip steps - being present for the entire lifecycle results in intuition (e.g. P0/P1) that‚Äôs handy when turbulence hits, but landing another pilot‚Äôs plane is unfamiliar

all the good (and bad) habits of a cross-functional team come across at ship time - any muscles built around communication pay off in speed of decision-making, any hangups around collaboration get exacerbated by the moment‚Äôs intensity

pulling the Andon Cord is hard, because we need time to acknowledge mistakes - part of me was willing to compromise, part of me just wanted to be done with it, and part of me wanted a 4th shot at it after re-jiggering the plan ‚Äúmy way‚Äù

failure is learning, but more importantly, the safety to fail multiple times is key - I still can‚Äôt believe my management chain gave me 3 chances in 24 hours, and even after that fiasco I went on to manage several key products without oversight

Be Nice to Engineering ,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/be-nice-to-engineering,"I recently got a note from a former engineering partner asking about ‚Äúwhat a good form of collaboration between product and engineering leadership would look like‚Äù.

Of course I asked about the why behind the question, and the response was eye-opening:

‚ÄúI somehow always find myself working for orgs where me asking the connection to business outcomes question is faced with criticism for me stepping out of line‚Äù

Woah. What?!?

We‚Äôve of course all been part of teams and projects where engineering was sidelined into a purely delivery role vs planning and learning, but it‚Äôs always jarring to hear directly from someone dealing with these shenanigans to the point where they wonder if their expectations are out of whack. While I‚Äôve seen product leaders keep engineering out of the loop on strategy many times, it always comes back to bite you.

In my view, there are 3 things an engineering leader is ultimately accountable for, and each of them requires them to have deep business context:

talent pipelining

pattern matching

outcome mapping

No amount of strategy perfection matters without the ability to actually build and ship product, which is why talent is job #1.  And the disproportionate makeup of most product teams is developers (followed by smaller ratios of PMs, Designers, Researchers, Analysts, etc). But it‚Äôs not just about creating a pipeline and closing candidates - engineering leaders have to ensure that the makeup of the team evolves with the needs of the org - examples include creating career ladders, introducing management hierarchy, and up-leveling promising people. And each of these hinges on the engineering leader being able to translate the broader business context into something digestible - otherwise, you risk folks being misaligned and just end up adding new talent for marginal gains.

The 2nd key asset a seasoned engineering leader brings is the ability to pattern match. For example, when there‚Äôs a service outage, is it a one-off black swan event or a sign of a system that‚Äôs going to have recurring issues? Or when the UI starts lagging with the latest release, is it a bug or the compounding effect of 1% latency hits over the last

n

releases? That judgement call on whether the org‚Äôs focus needs to be shifted or not based on day-to-day inputs is the experience that engineering leaders are hired for; but the pattern matching has to be blended with business context to make the right decisions. Maybe the outage was truly unpredictable, but re-earning customer trust might require spending cycles on system hardening work. Or maybe performance really has slowly but surely degraded, but maintaining delivery velocity and a feature gap vs competitors is the right prioritization. Product teams are idea factories, and engineering leaders need to have a clear pulse on shifting strategy and tactics in order to greenlight, end-of-life, de-risk, and prop up. Basically, without business context, the trade-offs calls start to become more wrong than right over time.

Lastly, true customer value and business impact (i.e. outcomes) are what product development is all about - but if you look at what any team is working on in a given day (organizing JIRA tickets, answering support questions, etc) it‚Äôs very hard to see how the dots connect. And for the leadership team of the company, everything comes down to a handful of key levers (revenue growth, market share, customer retention, product adoption, operating margins) - so the onus falls on engineering leadership to tie work on the ground to company objectives (this is why an engineering operations team usually gets pulled into the rollout of a framework like OKRs). But if engineering leaders don‚Äôt have business context, they won‚Äôt be able to pull a steel thread through all the layers of work happening in the org.

Any way you slice it, if you work in product development, it just makes business sense (short- and long- term) to be nice to engineering.

Bet Boldness,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/bet-boldness,"Recently, I‚Äôve been mulling over why product teams fall into an equilibrium of sorts when it comes to innovation. The Innovator‚Äôs Dilemma is always framed in terms of companies and categories, but what does that look like within a product development organization?

Over the last few years, I‚Äôve been working in environments where product work is framed as ‚Äúbets‚Äù. If you‚Äôve gone through any Reforge content you‚Äôre familiar with this concept of bet making. I‚Äôve even shared my own framework for different types of bets (features, fixes, foundation, future). But lately I‚Äôve been stepping back even further and thinking about the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind bets, and in my opinion there are 3 recurring reasons:

Increment: iteratively improve the product you have

Evolve: meaningully change the product you have

Invent: fundamentally build a new product based

I‚Äôll say it another way, using product hypothesis language:

Increment: keep going down the current solution path

Evolve: explore alternative solution paths to problem

Invent: revisit the problem without solution bias

So let‚Äôs dive deeper into each of these modes.

[1] Increment

When you have a widely adpopted solution, the leaning of the product team becomes maintaining and improving that baseline level of adoption. The focus is on what the historical uptake rates have been for incoming users, and how to optimize that. When an organization is in this mode, they have well-understood north star metrics and drivers, and a well-oiled product development machine designed to make incremental progress against those measures. To be clear, this is not a bad place to be if you are the major player in the market and your goal is to show you have a handle on your core flywheel.

[2] Evolve

When you are not the largest player in your space or there are external factors (competitor pressure, technical innovation) at play, you have to think about evolving your approach. This is tricky for product teams because they have to let go of investments they‚Äôve made in the past that may no longer be the optimal solution path, but it‚Äôs also very do-able because someone is showing their is a better way to address the needs of users in the market. So the change management hurdles are more about alignment and skillset vs concerns about technical feasibility or market viability. The hardest version of this is when there is no external pressure, so you get complacent, and user perception atrophies and becomes a drag on both product and success teams. One of the best methods I‚Äôve seen to combat this is to regularly re-surface the solution paths not taken for debate by your senior ICs in PM/design/engineering.

[3] Invent

Lack of invention and eventual disruption is what a lot of tech company literature covers, but I find most of that writing lacks empathy for what it‚Äôs like to be a product leader at a company that‚Äôs the king of the hill; it‚Äôs nearly impossible to get an organization to invest in bets that are orthogonal to the asks of customers and have no real timeline or guarantee of payoff. Invention is a luxury investment for an established product‚Ä¶until it‚Äôs suddenly not. Companies that successfully balance maximizing short-term outcomes while building their own future competitors in-house tend to do so through a combination of strategic hedging, buying innovation, and firewalling R&D teams.

tl;dr

The default mode for most orgs at scale is [1]. There are instances of [2] due to top-down (or external) pressure. But [3] doesn‚Äôt seem to happen much, if ever.

The whole conundrum reminds of this Jeff Bezos quote about process as proxy:

‚ÄúGood process serves you so you can serve customers. But if you're not watchful, the process can become the thing. This can happen very easily in large organizations. The process becomes the proxy for the result you want.‚Äù

Is this just classic Innovator‚Äôs Dilemma? Or is there a cultural reason why we lean towards [1]? Could we change something in terms of rituals / principles to do more [3]?

Building Hardware

What is hardware PMing anyways?

When I think of great people in hardware, Tony Fadell always comes to mind. As the inventor of the iPod, iPhone, and Nest Labs, he states that hardware PMs should figure out what the product should do, create the spec, work with every part of the business, and most importantly be the voice of the customer.

Run the Business is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.

While that definition doesn‚Äôt really differ from other PM domains, I find that the hardware community is lagging behind the software world when it comes to PMing and knowledge sharing. There‚Äôs a lot of great material about how to build apps and SaaS products.

In contrast, the hardware landscape is fragmented. You‚Äôll find blogs on mechanical or electrical engineering and separate posts from MBAs on supply chain sourcing strategies. But there aren‚Äôt many resources for learning how to build a 0 to 1 hardware product, involving both the technical and business sides of things.

There‚Äôs a barrier to entry for hardware and while there are many reasons for this, I think one of them is the education around unique challenges to physical product development such as:

Needing access to a lab, factory, and capital intensive equipment for prototype builds

Low gross margins (~20-45% consumer electronics, ~5% automotive)

Manufacturing at scale, without variations, and meeting safety standards is orders of magnitude more difficult than simply designing a concept

Long lead times for user feedback

Timelines being strict given that the cost of feature changes after dev commit is immense

Need for international travel and on the ground factory presence

And the list goes on. But hardware products also change the world. There‚Äôs a special feeling in designing, crafting, fabricating, and using a physical product. In this post I'm going to attempt to articulate some challenges in contrast to SW PMing.

How is it different from SW PMing?

Its difficult to illustrate what differs in the hardware space without providing an example. Let's talk about a scenario where a PM team has to develop two products in identical domains.

We‚Äôll explore a fitness focused smart watch and a health tracking app. The target users for both are health conscious millennials who are middle class earners. Let's also assume they‚Äôre struggling with motivation and value frugality as a purchasing trait.

Friendly disclaimer before we start, I‚Äôm aware that there are biases towards hardware development in the points below. Software is undoubtedly complex, nuanced, and challenging as it is but hey I was never good at coding anyways, so let's start.

Source: Yanko design, Canva

Schedule

App:

For starters the app may be developed using an agile framework and relative flexibility. A patch can be quickly deployed to fix bugs or changes with the exercise goal setting feature.

Watch:

To mass manufacture this watch without variation or safety issues we‚Äôll need to lock scope sometimes years before launch. Waterfall is a must once dev commit is reached and agile will only be used for early proof of concepts. Why? Well, if a PM wants a new feature post PRD lock, like motion tracking, then our engineers will need to add sensors (accelerometers). This will impact our PCB design (printed circuit board) and mechanical housings, resulting in schedule delays from the added time to remanufacture tooling and perform reliability testing.

Cost & Profitability

App:

The app will focus more on customer acquisition costs like digital marketing, user support, and server maintenance. It‚Äôll also have higher margins (~70-85%) due to low incremental cost per user after development.

Watch:

Our watch will focus on component costs such as the display, battery, sensing, chipset, & enclosure - called BOM cost (Bill of Materials). This is in addition to the headcount needed for assembly, material attrition, shipping, tariffs, and packaging. It‚Äôl have lower margins because of manufacturing constraints. Gross margins are usually ~20-50% in consumer electronics.

Scalability

App:

Adding new users will generally be a function of server capacity which is usually cost effective and relatively attainable.

Watch:

Scaling will be orders of magnitude harder. Going from 1K to 50K units will require CapEX into fixturing, tooling, FAT (factory acceptance testing), metrology, QC, SOPs, and assembly OP training to ensure we have a variation free process. After having worked in automotive, IoT, and consumer electronics I have never had a smooth ramp into mass production. Something always breaks - whether it‚Äôs a machine, process, test, or design. And that‚Äôs okay.

Engineering Iterations

App

: Teams will generally have fluid sessions for system architecture, dev work, debugging, and data analysis. For this app a new calorie tracking feature can be deployed relatively quickly after dev/QA.

Watch:

The greatest challenge will be the inability to rapidly prototype and gain design feedback. For example if we want to test waterproofing, we‚Äôll have to wait weeks to ensure the chipsets, seals, & housings are at the latest design and production maturation level. Also get used to working with mechanical, electrical, and firmware engineering teams.

Supply Chain

App

: We‚Äôll rely on cloud services for managing server load and app stores for distribution to our customers.

Watch:

This will require navigation of supplier sourcing, contract manufacturers, inventory, tariffs, logistics, and build volumes. There‚Äôs also significant on the ground travel from business and technical teams. For example, the watch‚Äôs leather band could be sourced from Mexico, ICs from Taiwan, display from South Korea, housings from China, and final assembly in India.

Design

App:

Our feel, aesthetic, and usability will be developed by UI/UX designers through various wireframes and digital mockups. Choosing one concept over another can be done fairly quickly with A/B testing.

Watch:

Cosmetics and form factor will be led by the industrial design team. Industrial designers are basically artists with a great intuition of technology and manufacturing processes. They‚Äôll ideate on concepts for CMF (colors, materials, finishes). Validating these will be expensive and time consuming given the need for machine shop tools and 3D printing.

Regulations

App:

At minimum we‚Äôll need to meet GPPR and HIPAA¬† to ensure customer data is secured and encrypted.

Watch:

We have to comply with regulatory standards like CE for safety compliance and FCC for electronic emissions. Ensuring the smart watch doesn‚Äôt emit harmful radiation and complies with electrical standards might take months of testing and design changes.

User Feedback

App:

Feedback can be logged from usage analytics and fixes can be deployed rapidly on UX issues like slow load screens or non intuitive menu selection.

Watch:

There‚Äôs more friction involved in gaining customer insights because we can‚Äôt just press a button for new feature releases. We‚Äôll need to issue minimum order quantities to our contract manufacturer, run units down a production line, and ship physical prototypes (likely across the pacific ocean) to our alpha and beta testers. It's vital for our users to have tangible, hands-on experience with the watch to detect issues with heart rate monitoring, comfort, or weight.

Sustainability

App:

While there isn't really a direct correlation to carbon emissions from the app, there will be an implicit impact from the supporting infrastructure like servers, cooling, and data center equipment.

Watch:

We‚Äôll have to make design decisions to ensure environmental compliance within the watch itself. For example will we use aluminum instead of steel for the chassis so that it‚Äôs recyclable? For the inner frame can we try reused plastic? In theory sure, but in reality this will compromise mechanical properties and will be more expensive. Let‚Äôs also not forget carbon emissions in the overall production, shipping, and lifetime usage.

Given that great products provide compelling experiences by leveraging both software and hardware harmoniously, we have many opportunities to converge as builders in the physical and digital worlds.

Takeaways

If you‚Äôre new to building hardware products - whether it's for a startup, an ask from leadership, a personal interest, or just plain curiosity - I‚Äôm hoping this post helped shed light into our world.

At least on a surface level, you can have a sense of what to expect and how to gauge feasibility. We talked about paint points such as the added scope required to de-risk product development teams.

Remember that making physical devices generally takes longer, is capital intensive, requires navigation of unique engineering constraints, is lower margin, introduces a new variable in working with supply chains, and is more abrasive when it comes to getting user feedback.

Finally, one concept which summarizes HW PMing¬† is

‚ÄúGenba‚Äù

, a Japanese lean manufacturing term which means

actual place

. Whether it's testing units in a lab, walking the production floor, or having prototypes in our hands we can‚Äôt just rely on a picture, email, or videos for updates. In the physical device world we need to be intimately involved with the products we build.

Buried Treasure,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/buried-treasure,"As product folks, we spend so much (too much?) time focusing on what to build next. The product roadmap is heavily skewed towards the shiny future. Our customer comms is focused on upcoming feature messaging. Teams obsess over the adoption of new capabilities. We over-index seller and support enablement on the latest and greatest. But if you step back and think about your product portfolio holistically, what‚Äôs already out there vs yet-to-be-built-and-released probably follows an 80/20 split.

In a way, your existing product is buried treasure. And it‚Äôs being buried by your future product.

Listening to a podcast on short-form writing recently, this patten came through clearly in the publishing industry.

‚ÄúWe greatly overvalue recency. Your job is to persuade the reader that today‚Äôs newspaper is the product, and yesterday‚Äôs newspaper is for cat litter. We‚Äôre still hostage to that mindset.‚Äù

And it‚Äôs not just blog posts / newsletter articles / Tweets that fall prey to this, it‚Äôs long-form writing and other media categories as well.

‚ÄúNobody ever goes into a bookshop and says ‚ÄòI would like your most recent book please‚Äô. And nobody ever says ‚ÄòI‚Äôm not going to listen to that music because it was written 5 years ago‚Äô.‚Äù

Product development is a creative, team-based endeavor just like writing a book or producing an album or making a movie. And the value of any creative content is in the collection, not in the newest release. In fact, the greatest hits and outsized value are hiding in the long-tail catalog. Ideally, if done right, the latest offering should actually be a gateway to the corpus.

‚ÄùYou‚Äôre so busy adding today‚Äôs new layer of soil on top of your mountain that eventually you forget what all the buried treasures are that are in there, let alone where they are.‚Äù

So as you‚Äôre designing / building / shipping products, remember to highlight what you‚Äôve already produced and provided for your users. The new stuff should layer onto the tremendous value that already exists.

Can We Demo Now?,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/can-we-demo-now,"Recently, I learned a fascinating lesson from

a friend who‚Äôs building a B2B company

- his take was that while a great product is important, what he really wished he‚Äôd learned much earlier was how to sell. In fact, he was so committed to getting better at sales that he‚Äôd hired a sales coach. And he shared an anecdote about how he utilizes the methods the coach has taught him to date. Which I‚Äôve turned into this stylized narrative, written from the perspective of a prospective C-level buyer who‚Äôs been talked into taking a meeting with some small software vendor as a favor to an investor friend, thinking he‚Äôs going to get a quick demo and hopefully cut the 1 hour session short‚Ä¶

How‚Äôs our <insert-tech-buzz-word> deployment going? I mean, it‚Äôs

How do we go from

? Like I said, I don‚Äôt spend too many cycles on <insert-tech-buzz-word> - I have a team that handles it. I guess if I really think about it,

amazing

would look like that team being 80% smaller. But that‚Äôs not likely‚Ä¶

Why is it unlikely? I mean, that‚Äôs just the way <insert-tech-buzz-word> goes, right? It takes a huge team to manage.

Yeah, I did say I don‚Äôt spend too many cycles on it. But we‚Äôve always had a huge team on <insert-tech-buzz-word> since Day 1. I don‚Äôt see that changing‚Ä¶

What do you mean whose decision is that? I guess it‚Äôs my decision‚Ä¶but I don‚Äôt see a reason to distract my team with an evaluation. They‚Äôre so swamped right now‚Ä¶

Why are they so swamped? You know, I‚Äôm not really in the weeds on <insert-tech-buzz-word>, so I don‚Äôt know why the team is always under water‚Ä¶

Who would know? Bob is my lead for the area - he would definitely know what his team is up to on <insert-tech-buzz-word>...

Can we call Bob now? Yeah, you know‚Ä¶yeah, we can. Even I‚Äôm curious now as to what this whole team is up to around <insert-tech-buzz-word>...

Put him on speaker? Yeah, yeah - sure. Hey Bob! No, no - no issue. Just sitting here with this guy who runs a company focused on <insert-tech-buzz-word>.

Yeah, exactly. I told him you were our expert on <insert-tech-buzz-word>. So lemme ask you Bob‚Ä¶why do we need a team of X people on this right now?

Yeah, yeah - exactly. It‚Äôs always been that way since Day 1. Just takes X people to run it. That‚Äôs exactly what I was saying earlier. But Bob‚Ä¶if the team was 80% leaner, what do we lose? We could put those folks to work on higher priority stuff for our business instead of <insert-tech-buzz-word> maintenance‚Ä¶

I hear you, lots of surface to cover. Yeah, so much ‚Äúkeep the lights on‚Äù work. No, your team is under-water, I get it Bob. Just wanted to get a pulse‚Ä¶

What‚Äôs that now? You know, that‚Äôs a great question! What is all the surface your team is covering on <insert-tech-buzz-word>?

Oh I gotcha. Yeah it probably is a lot to explain on the phone. Maybe we can do a session on it sometime‚Ä¶

What‚Äôs that now? You know, that‚Äôs a great idea! Could you come into my office right now and walk me through it?¬† I have the whole hour blocked off‚Ä¶

You‚Äôll need time to prepare a slide deck? Hmm, yeah, I get that‚Ä¶

What‚Äôs that now? I love it! This guy is full of helpful suggestions! Just show us the product! Can we demo our product to this guy over Zoom right now?

Hmm, it takes X people to run

this

? Seems kind of like a lot‚Ä¶

Yeah, I hear you Bob. We do have to improve the initial setup.

No, no, I get it. I definitely heard folks want a faster experience.

Really, I know Bob. You‚Äôve always told me about this limitation with <insert-tech-buzz-word>.

What‚Äôs that now? You‚Äôve built your product with a super-simple setup flow? With a much faster experience. And your key innovation is that you overcame the limitation around <insert-tech-buzz-word>? I‚Äôd love to see that‚Ä¶that would free up 80% of the X people on Bob‚Äôs team!

What do you mean our hour is up? Yeah, no, we can definitely follow up. I‚Äôm going to make sure Bob connects with you. This is going to be his #1 priority‚Ä¶.

Don‚Äôt thank me for my time! Now I really want to see your product in action - and I don‚Äôt want to wait another week! If you can stay a little longer, I can skip my next meeting‚Ä¶

Cargo Culting Culture,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/cargo-culting-culture,"The idea of cargo culting is an interesting organizational anti-pattern [1] [2]. During my Twitter tenure, I heard it used in an even broader context - blindly attempting to copy/paste culture [3]. For example, Google is successful, Google does pooled hiring, we should do pooled hiring. Not only did the idea not make any sense for Twitter, it also backfired spectacularly (hiring managers were disempowered, teams fought over pipeline, decision were dragged out, close rates plummeted, etc). Pooled hiring not working at Twitter isn‚Äôt a knock on the idea itself or Twitter recruiting (my BFFs!), but more a reflection of Twitter culture not being Google culture, and rejecting a practice that felt grafted on.

Connecting B2B Products to Revenue,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/connecting-b2b-products-to-revenue,"I wrote an

unconventional post

(my stream of consciousness thoughts while reading a Twitter thread) about 6 months ago that sparked a lot of discussion from readers. The following sentence in particular elicited a lot of reactions:

‚Äúin B2B products, you have to connect to revenue (generation or preservation)‚Äù

The 2 big questions that came up were:

Why does product have to connect to revenue?

How do you actually show that connection?

Yesterday‚Äôs

audio post

answered question #1. Today I‚Äôd like to elaborate on question #2.

At the highest level, a B2B business can be broken down into 3 KPIs:

growth

retention

margins

When stating that product has to connect to revenue, I‚Äôm taking into account how each of these top-level metrics has a revenue component:

growth ‚Üí revenue generation

retention ‚Üí revenue preservation

margins ‚Üí revenue sustainability

Now these business KPIs might be too big a jump for a product org to rally around - what‚Äôs more likely during a planning cycle (annual / bi-annual / quarterly) is to think about major metrics levers you can impact. Something like this:

The key takeaway here is that product strategy should be oriented around moving levers which ultimately ladder up to top-level business KPIs.

Ok, so this line of thinking might make sense to someone on the product leadership team, but if you‚Äôre a PM accountable to a team that‚Äôs just trying to connect their day-to-day output to the larger story, how do you demonstrate that? Your on-the-ground concerns are probably things like active users or CSAT or time to activate or add-on attach rate or cost of the notifications infrastructure.

It can all connect.

No matter what your product team‚Äôs north star is, this framework can be used to connect the dots from top to bottom. The one instance where product work doesn‚Äôt connect at all is a disjointed company (i.e. the product value has no correlation to business value).

So let‚Äôs go back to the 3 top-level metrics, and how product can impact them:

product can help land / close deals OR just activate a user base for eventual monetization -> revenue growth

product can help prevent churn by increasing usage sophistication / encouraging stickiness  -> revenue preservation

product can help reduce the cost to run the service OR unlock charging premium pricing -> revenue sustainability

This concept of ‚Äúladdering‚Äù is critical not only for PMs who lead product teams to absorb but also their peers / partners. From an accountability / leverage perspective, a product team that‚Äôs spinning its wheels could be (a) more marketing budget (b) more sales reps (c) more support agents etc.

You could interpret this in 2 ways:

consultants are frauds because they don‚Äôt build products

when you deflect accountability, you avoid real learning

My preferred interpretation is the latter. If you watch the 2 minute video, you‚Äôll hear several critical points:

ownership over a sustained period gives you perspective

seeing your recommendations actually play out matters

the accumulation of scar tissue helps build up resilience

accountability extends to both planning and execution

operating at a superficial level is a missed opportunity

Having spent over 5 years in a consulting firm, I saw the anti-patterns above time and again. But it wasn‚Äôt always from the consultants. With 3/4 of my career taking place outside consulting, I‚Äôve cross paths with tons of folks who aren‚Äôt owners, who lack resilience, who shirk accountability, etc. The reality is we all have ‚Äúconsulting capacity‚Äù, and it‚Äôs a trap we can all stumble into. If you‚Äôre thinking ‚Äúnot me‚Äù, ask yourself if you‚Äôve ever used a Steve Jobs story to get around the fact that you‚Äôre operating ‚Äúa mile wide, an inch deep‚Äù (watch the video)‚Ä¶

Consumerizing Enterprise == Loop Sequencing,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/consumerizing-enterprise-loop-sequencing,"‚Äúthe only kind of writing is rewriting‚Äù

- Hemingway

This is going to be an evergreen post connecting loose threads and tying to future articles. It also heavily stitches together writing from some very clear thinkers I‚Äôve been studying. I encourage you to read the whole thing, in Ernest.

Working at Box for the last 2.5 years, I‚Äôve learned a ton about enterprise software, SaaS models, go-to-market (GTM) motions, and business scaling. The notion that

product-market fit might not be enough

was an eye-opener. The concept of

GTM-fit

was a game-changer. But the biggest, recurring lesson around scaling that I‚Äôve absorbed can be summarized in 1 word:

repeatability

. As much as you may have internalized the instinct to

do things that don‚Äôt scale

, ultimately, to get to a point where you can just ‚Äúrun the business‚Äù, you have to scale; this means figuring out an aligned product and GTM strategy that can start (and sustain) a flywheel.

I love the flywheel analogy (even wrote an internal white-paper titled ‚ÄòPlatform Flywheel‚Äô) because it conjures up the image of repeatability, once you get over the initial bootstrap hurdle (i.e. you can do things that don‚Äôt scale as long as you understand it‚Äôs all in the interest of eventually scaling). But over time, I‚Äôve shifted from seeing businesses as flywheels to‚Ä¶loops.

recently wrote an essay (

Why Figma Wins

) that felt like the last piece of a slowly-coming-together puzzle to me. It‚Äôs nominally about Figma‚Äôs growth strategy, but if you read it 3 times (like I did) you realize it‚Äôs about something more meta. He literally spells it out in the first sentence:

‚ÄúCompanies are a sequencing of loops.‚Äù

If you run with that idea, and apply it to horizontal, consumerized, enterprise SaaS (which has been my puzzle of choice for a few years), you see a playbook for a successful company (and business (and product)). The sequencing of loops is as follows:

individual -> team productivity

consumer -> creator mixshift

extended enterprise -> ecosystem

Don‚Äôt let the simplicity of the series fool you - in order to actually get one loop going is  a huge accomplishment, and transitioning from one level to the next requires a cultural and strategic transition. Many companies plateau in one stage and can never break through to their next potential phase because they don‚Äôt recognize (or maneuver against) their

invisible asymptotes

.

Walking through the

Figma analysis

helps outline the story that I‚Äôve summarized as 3 sequential loops.

Individual -> Team Productivity

Any software tool that helps a professional 10x their productivity has value, along with the potential for monetization. The first loop you need to automate is the self-service flow of a knowledge worker (PM, designer, engineer, sales rep, marketer, CSM) seeing that productivity boost and choosing to use your product (over competition, over status quo, over ad-hoc spreadsheets, etc). But individual efficiency gain is merely a trojan horse tactic, because the real money is in enterprise budgets vs. individual enterprises.

When you model the employees within an enterprise, your initial target customer (aka core user) works within many larger, cross-functional processes (with adjacent users). Adjacent users are critical to cross-team collaboration, and removing team-level friction (and thereby enhancing efficiency and effectiveness) is the key customer promise behind the consumerization of enterprise software (think of this as the MVP loop for a horizontal enterprise play).

The focus on teams highlights an aspect of user research which is critical: observe teams as they collaborate, not individuals as they work. These observations help identify the lowest-hanging fruit for the purposes of loop-building, and they are always obvious in hindsight once user behavior has changed over time. For example, with Figma, the biggest

aha!

‚Äôs are not having to think about version collisions, not having to install software, etc.

Finally, if you‚Äôve already started with the team mindset (e.g. enable design vs enable designers) and are wondering who your core vs adjacent users are, it‚Äôs whoever owns the output of the process and up-levels their role in the org as the process matures; therefore, personas with significant accountability and a desire for a seat at the table are prime candidates for such products (horizontal, consumerized, enterprise SaaS). If you serve the core user well enough, they in turn serve as your product champion within the broader organization.

The key takeaways for the

individual -> team productivity

loop are:

enterprises will pay for team (but not individual) productivity gains

user research should index on team collaboration (core + adjacent users)

core-user friction x team-level collaboration = enterprise-wide value

Consumer -> Creator Mixshift

The next loop that comes along after you‚Äôve proven out meaningful value within a particular (type of) team in an organization is replicating that across the enterprise. Again, from the Figma scenario, improving product quality through better designer / non-designer interactions for 1 product / 1 team is not the same as all products / all teams. But how do you get to enterprise-wide deployment? The traditional, brute-force, high-touch way has been to run sales plays where you identify incremental use cases and get to a tipping point where wall-to-wall (i.e. all employees have licenses) makes financial sense for the buyer. But if you‚Äôre thinking in terms of self-sustaining loops, there has to be a way to do this through product-led growth.

The answer is cross-side network effects, which the multi-disciplinary nature of collaboration in the modern organization biases towards. This is not to be confused with virality, which manifests as popularity within a function (e.g. designers loving Figma); the reason I point this out is the rate of adoption (virality) doesn‚Äôt correlate to value generated (monetizability) for an enterprise. But cross-functional adoption of a tool isn‚Äôt enough, because many folks in the collaboration chain end up as consumers vs creators; if you‚Äôve ever been in an enterprise software sales conversation, you‚Äôve heard the customer argument that they don‚Äôt need a seat for employee

X

because they are ‚Äúview-only‚Äù. If I was on the procurement side of a Figma purchase, I‚Äôd argue that viewing design assets within the app shouldn‚Äôt require a full license. But if you can expand the definition of design to more than the work designers do (e.g. design review is curation, and curation is a type of creation) then you have a compelling case for monetization. What this means in practice is users that at first blush are just consumers over time become 1st / 2nd order creators, and that conversion funnel is your next loop.

The path from an 80/20 consumer/creator split to a better (monetization-wise) blend is what I‚Äôm referring to as a mixshift. The specific tactics you employ will depend on the product domain, but ultimately you‚Äôre reducing barriers to creation until you break through the asymptote. Failure to successfully get traction on this dimension means you have a valuable product but not a viable business (because you can‚Äôt capture enough of the enterprise budget). In addition to just the ratio of creators to consumers, you will likely also want to measure conversion speed, because time to ROI is a key metric from a customer point of view.

The key takeaways for the

consumer -> creator mixshift

loop are:

there is a tipping point of team-level productivity gains to get to wall-to-wall

your product itself has to convert consumers to creators via network effects

if team-level productivity is the buyer‚Äôs ROI, then time to ROI matters a lot too

Extended Enterprise -> Ecosystem

If you‚Äôve managed to build a business that captures mindshare for a professional concerned with efficiency, enables their broader team to be more effective, and squirrels its way across their organization to a point where a purchase is a formality, that is likely a very successful product. But there is a difference between products and platforms. Ultimately, the production of user value is a concern that can be juggled by multiple entities, and the reason to even entertain such a model goes back to the start of this post:

scale

. In short, platforms scale better than linear businesses.

But where do you begin your platform journey? Since you‚Äôve been building a consumer-flavored enterprise product which orients on cross-team productivity gains, you start with a special case of your adjacent user: the extended enterprise collaborator. Basically, you have folks that your employees work with that sit outside your official organizational boundary: contractors / integrators / aggregators. As you research these users, you‚Äôll find that your product by itself / your company with its makeup cannot serve them (well enough)‚Ä¶but there are potential partners who can. And if you can cook up a viable platform strategy / equitable partner incentives, the net result is an ecosystem.

This whole post has been about sequencing loops to break through a series of asymptotes - so how does an ecosystem come into play? Over time, you run into a plateau where new users outside an organization don‚Äôt see compounding value when they join (what

the Figma article

refers to as global vs local network effects). An ecosystem provides that clear value proposition to the extended enterprise.

The key takeaways for the

extended enterprise -> ecosystem

loop are:

adjacent users exist both within the official and extended org

your product + platform strategy + partner entities = ecosystem

ecosystems can scale network effects from local -> global

To recap, a horizontal, consumerized, enterprise SaaS play has 3 primary loops to sequence:

individual -> team productivity

consumer -> creator mix-shift

extended enterprise -> ecosystem

There are a bunch of underlying assumptions, known unknowns, and implicit trends suggested here, which I‚Äôve ordered according to how easily (most to least) they poke holes in my argument:

enterprises measure (or even care about) team-level productivity

team-level productivity actually correlates to product quality (sounds right)

‚Äúteam‚Äù definitions mature from reporting-based to collaboration-based

there are horizontal cross-industry / cross-segment domino use cases

a single product can support bottoms-up and top-down GTM motions

users and buyers share an understanding of product value / purchase rationale (this a topic for a future post where I explore user vs. buyer ‚Äúproduct feedback‚Äù)

a route-to-market exists in a majority of enterprises (more often than not IT shuts downs or isolates to a department tools based on security / compliance risk)

implicit business processes (and the latent cross-team collaboration therein) can be repeatably and reliably modeled as a series of use cases (

see prescient Tweet

)

enterprises are enlightened enough and politically emboldened enough to elevate core users and empower adjacent users (you are fighting inertia / status quo)

a repeatable motion that combines bottoms-up / product-led growth + top-down / GTM-led distribution exists (this post attempts to outline the strategic playbook)

Assuming all of the above holds true, becomes known, and pans out, I‚Äôm in agreement with Kevin Kwok when he says:

‚ÄúThis new type of enterprise company is a mix of both product-driven consumer and sales-driven enterprise. We are still early when it comes to companies understanding how to re-architect their org structure, GTM motion, pricing model, and more to best fit this model. And like SaaS before it, this bottom-up to top-down model will mature from art to science over the coming years.‚Äù

Customer Experience Loops,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/customer-experience-loops,"As readers know, I‚Äôve been experimenting with different ways to communicate ideas this year (starting with

the audio post

a few weeks ago). So when I was asked to do a webinar with the

ProdPad

team, I jumped at the chance. And I decided to focus my talk on Customer Experience (CX) Loops, which is a topic that I thought would be easier to tackle with prepared slides + hand-wavy examples + live Q&A. You can see links to the recording and presentation below, but I wanted to touch on a few concepts I didn‚Äôt get to elaborate on in the webinar‚Ä¶

Customer feedback is critical to product teams (to create hypotheses, to validate solutions, to synthesize learnings, to identify problems), but there are too many channels of varying quality to plug into. And as companies scale, systemically getting meaningful interactions with actual users of the product is difficult. Having worked at a SaaS company the last 3 years, where I had hundreds of customer conversations, I can honestly say I spoke more to buyers / influencers / implementors / administrators than

users

. Furthermore, 20% of customers (the largest, the noisiest, the buzziest) tend to get 80% of the attention.

So how do you overcome these complications? In the slides / talk, I cover 3 dimensions of feedback, and offer a strong point of view on how to set up:

collecting - directly from customer vs using proxies and partners

operationalizing - leveraging CX touchpoints vs other channels

distilling - learning loops vs one-off, over-biased, pre-planned chats

And the reason I focused on CX loops as an ideal conduit of product feedback was my own experience seeing the practice in action at multiple career stops.

at Amazon, via shadowing programs at call / fulfillment centers

at Twitter, through VIT (Very Important Tweeter) support channels

at Box, by doing rapid-fire, new-prospect meetings at BoxWorks

at Amplitude, with rounds of listening to user research recordings

When you actually observe a CX touchpoint live, and have to facilitate the workflow and navigate speedbumps, that learning loop is invaluable in developing user empathy. But the best example I came across was an anecdote I saw in my LinkedIn feed, which I summarized into a pithy quote:

‚Äúwatch the bartender‚Äù - Jack Dorsey

Of course, there are a number of ways this practice can be screwed up:

attempting to ‚Äúlearn‚Äù only when you need to confirm a theory

limiting access to only a select few vs any product team member

not documenting, synthesizing, and socializing learnings broadly

overloading only front-line knowledge workers with customer pain

So like any idea, CX loops only work if they‚Äôre a cultural norm, for every employee, via regular interlocks, and woven into the leadership ladder - otherwise, they won‚Äôt stick.

If you‚Äôre currently working on improving how you collect / operationalize / distill customer feedback, I also recommend watching the Q&A session at the end talk.

I‚Äôd love to hear from readers who‚Äôve seen or implemented CX feedback loops - please chime in via commentsüëá. And if you enjoyed this post,  please consider

Customer Zero,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/customer-zero,"As companies get larger and more complex, there‚Äôs a tendency to manage to proxies. A common example is process as proxy. Good process serves you so you can serve customers. But if you‚Äôre not watchful, the process can become the thing.

Ever have one of those days when you‚Äôre doing the thing but you‚Äôve lost track of why

the thing

is

THE THING

? We all have those moments, and in such instances I find it useful to reset my state of mind to something I‚Äôll call ‚Äúcustomer zero‚Äù.

My team in my Kindle days worked on a variety of cross-org problems, one of which was running beta programs for new product launches. We had a couple of teammates that ran that effort like a well-oiled machine - device after device, release after release, patch after patch went through a rigorous cycle to ensure it was customer ready. And (this didn't dawn on anyone at the time) it really was just a couple of folks managing beta testing simultaneously for multiple products. Just goes to show that when someone truly owns something they scale up to do more and make it look easy to outsiders.

One day (let's call it the start of the perfect storm) everyone who knows anything about running beta efforts goes on vacation. There's a backup plan in place where we have anther person on the team manage the day-to-day work, which basically entails:

reviewing the incoming queue of reported bugs

verifying issues by going through the same actions as the user

updating tickets with details (screenshots, build details, stack traces)

cleaning up multiple reports of the same problem

tracking progress of fixes for high severity issues

communicating with the participant pool on updates / patches

That was our high-level understanding of what the beta folks did day in and day out. That was, in fact,

my

understanding of it (shame on my former self) - so when I had someone cover for the out-of-office folks, I diligently ensured that their explicit responsibilities were what we focused on. But I completely neglected understanding what they implicitly owned.

So, this PM on my team starts managing the beta feedback. And he goes absolutely nuts. A couple of days into it he comes by my desk with an epic rant‚Ä¶

He can't keep up with the feedback. He can't follow the user reports to reliably recreate bugs in our environment. The beta pool is using

n

different builds and he never knows if bugs aren't fixed or people are just on stale builds. It's hard to take a screenshot with the device. Every report of ""critical bugs"" he sends out is out of date the minute it leaves his inbox. He's spending all day resolving duplicate tickets in JIRA. It's too easy for people to auto-file bugs from the device but they won't respond to his emails asking for more details. He can't do it anymore - he needs help.

I immediately get him help to deal with the volume of work and make a mental note to follow up with the usual beta leads to understand how they manage things. Clearly the veterans had been approaching things in a way that was less stressful and more sustainable.

Everyone gets back from vacation and we do a little pow-wow on how things went. For the folks who covered the program, the general vibe was this had turned out to be more work than expected and the knowledge transfer wasn't handled well. They walked into the discussion with ""you didn't tell me there was this much cat herding!""

Our more seasoned beta leads listened to the feedback, chuckled, and then responded with:

""Cat herding? We don't herd cats. We spend all our time dog fooding.""

Silence.

""What?""

""All we do is play with the device and dogfood builds. All day, every day. We pretend we're users. Everything else is just noise.""

""What?!!""

""No one knows this product better than us. We are customer zero.""

""How do you deal with the zillion JIRA tickets?""

""We rarely see a ticket that we don't already know about. We only go into JIRA occasionally to bulk select and resolve as known. Were you spending all day trying to keep up with the never-ending tickets?!""

""But how do you generate the top issues list?""

‚ÄúThat's everything getting in the way of shipping - we just use JIRA tickets to validate that we're not the only ones thinking it's a ship-blocker.""

Silence.

From that day forward, we revised the beta lead job description:

dogfood the product all day long

That was the gist of it.

I'm over-simplifying for the purposes of storytelling, but the lesson we learned was owning something (in this case product quality) was a better approach than going through the mechanics of generating artifacts (in this case critical bug reports).

So if you‚Äôre ever having one those weeks where you feel like you‚Äôre going through the motions‚Ä¶pause, take a breath, and put your ‚Äúcustomer zero‚Äù hat on.

I‚Äôd love to hear from readers (via comments section below) on situations where they got caught up in serving the process vs. serving the customer‚Ä¶

CXBR: The Other Amazon Bar Raiser,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/cxbr-the-other-amazon-bar-raiser,"It‚Äôs been a decade (!) since I started at Amazon as a PM in the Kindle org, but I remember it like it was yesterday. Having just gone through their (in)famous hiring process, I was ready to hit the ground running on Day 1*. After being rejected once, years earlier, by a bar raiser, I‚Äôd prepared intensely and made it through. The myth of the bar raiser (I‚Äôll detail my encounter in a future post) has reached a point where there are

forums

and

articles

littered with advice on navigating the experience.

But there is another bar raiser program at Amazon that is rarely talked about, which comes into play once you‚Äôre an employee: the Customer Experience Bar Raiser (CXBR).

My first week at Amazon started with a 1/2 day of new hire orientation, followed by a quick lunch with my manager, and then I was immediately thrown into the deep end. There was a new device (retroactively named the

Kindle Keyboard

) in the works, which was anticipated to the be the ‚ÄúToyota Camry‚Äù of  e-readers (i.e. everyone would buy one and hold onto it for years). The key word was ‚Äúbuy‚Äù, as I was the PM on point for the online sales experience.

Within 24 hours, I was in a review with the powers that be, discussing the MVP of the buying experience for the pre-announcement of the device. Luckily, there was a shell of a spec that a couple of other folks on my team / my boss had drafted. The conversation keyed in on the international purchase experience, which had been a pain point for prior generations devices - specifically, buyers outside the US were ending up with the wrong

ASIN

because they didn‚Äôt realize there was a different SKU with an international adapter intended for them. The business impact was a lower-than-projected accessory attach rate combined with a higher-than-expected device return rate. We brainstormed a few proposals for how to address this:

better messaging on the detail page (aka product listing)

using customer profile nuggets (IP address, shipping address)

confirmation when adding to cart / clicking the buy button

an interstitial during the cart checkout / order confirmation

(1) was low likelihood of success, (2) didn‚Äôt work for the logged out UX, (3) was a no-no [never add friction when the user clicks ‚Äúbuy‚Äù] and (4) seemed like it had legs.

So one of the people in the meeting says ‚Äúif you‚Äôre thinking of adding a page to the checkout process, I call for a CXBR review‚Äù. And I said:

‚Äúwhat‚Äôs a CXBR?‚Äù - me (only on Day 2*)

A CXBR (customer experience bar raiser) was, I would quickly find out, an

OG

Amazonian, whose day job was something or other, but was willing to spend 20% time doing on-demand reviews of

any

product changes deemed by

any

concerned employee to be f-ing with

any

core CX. And I was, per the spec, definitely f-ing with the most critical of CX‚Äôs.

What was briefly a moment of fear actually quickly turned into an amazing learning opportunity, as I was assigned a CXBR who was on the order pipeline team and knew everything about everything with regards to online product purchases via Amazon.com. This person gave me a template for how to frame things for the review (clear personas, crisp data) and provided me with the criteria for how to think about the problem (buying friction, checkout latency). We ended up having less of a ‚Äúreview meeting‚Äù and more of a ‚Äúideation session‚Äù, and the proposed solution actually got refined significantly (FYI-ing the customer vs asking for a decision, swapping out the item in the cart with a clear message / call to action, input on how to ensure performance latency didn‚Äôt regress). Within a few days, we had a path forward along with the afterglow of a successful CXBR engagement.

All of this happened within my first week. I think sometimes about this period of exponential learning (a term I‚Äôll elaborate on in a future post) and I‚Äôm 100% convinced that my onboarding experience was the #1 factor in my future impact in Kindle (more war stories to come). I‚Äôm also convinced that a less rapid ramp (from a cognitive load perspective) would have done me no favors. To recap, I grasped the 7 lessons below in my first 7 days:

solving customer pain (aka creating user value) is the basis for writing a spec

good specs have clear business outcomes (+attach rate, -return rate, etc)

healthy teams enable others to ship (vs creating a spider web of dependencies)

documenting (simple, living wikis) a product‚Äôs vocabulary is critical to execution

you (as a non-exec) can make any decision with a cogent plan for why/how

product principles (e.g. customer obsession) should be obvious in the day-to-day

tenure, hierarchy, title can‚Äôt beat clarity of thought (aka

writing is thinking

)

I‚Äôd love to hear from readers on their best / worst onboarding experiences, and perhaps this gives leaders some food for thought on how they‚Äôve engineered the first 30/60/90 days for their new hires‚Ä¶

Data vs Intuition,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/data-vs-intuition,"A question from this newsletter‚Äôs mailbag (yes you can email me) recently piqued my interest - a reader asked whether their answer to my ‚Äúdata vs intuition‚Äù

WMT interview question

passed the sniff test. I‚Äôm copy/pasting the original question and rationale below:

‚Äúwalk me through a product trade-off where the data in your hands vs the intuition in your head didn‚Äôt jive, and how you made sense of it‚Äù

from this I can learn:

what level of trade-offs you have made

if you use data and to what degree

do you over-rely on data to guide

how you build / refine product instinct

if you follow curiosity or index on delivery

The reader‚Äôs answer was sometimes you see a data point that seems too good to be true, and talking to customers can provide the context to gauge whether it is or isn‚Äôt. I ask this question in phone screens pretty regularly, and it‚Äôs pretty common to hear an example where the internal metrics dashboard and the external customer voice are the source of the tension. One of the reasons I like this question is I‚Äôm always looking to learn new ways to blend quantitative and qualitative insights, which I think is the real magic of product development. But this reader‚Äôs response led me to another realization - one way to connect quant and qual insights is to think of them as 2 ends of a shared view, zoomed-out at one end and zoomed-in on the other end. For example, in the situation the reader shared, the data insight was a zoomed-in view, but the customer conversation layered on the zoomed-out view.

Here are some concrete examples:

interviewing a set of users with a common profile can help you shortlist 1 shared problem to scope and solve for them (zoomed-out / qualitative), but running an A/B test with different UX variations can help identify the optimal solution path to take (zoomed-in / quantitative)

looking at a category‚Äôs TAM can determine whether your company should invest in the space (zoomed-out / quantitative), but talking to analysts who cover the domain can shape the differentiated solution you build (zoomed-in / qualitative)

I know ‚Äúblend qual and quant when making product decisions‚Äù is not a new takeaway, but being aware of whether you‚Äôre zoomed out or zoomed in and knowing what altitude to bridge things is useful. To go back to the original WMT question, I think the best examples of data vs intuition conundrums are when the zoomed-out and zoomed-in views don‚Äôt reconcile:

we built a thing that we heard a legitimate need for, but now no one is using it

we optimized a painful user workflow, but the user survey reactions were meh

we knew the adoption curve of our product follows a particular pattern, but that turned out not to be true when we entered a new geographic region

the intended usage of our product was X, but then users kept using it for Y

Death & Taxes in B2B,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/death-and-taxes-in-b2b,"In the B2B domain, between buying into a vision of your product and actually fulfilling that vision / achieving real value, there are a slew of hurdles that your prospects and customers face, and these add up to a total cost of ownership (TCO) that you should be focused on minimizing as a company and product team.

Evaluating a tool and doing a pilot is work - there is an

appraisal tax

Using a tool means procuring software - there is a

licensing cost

Initial setup and deployment is work - there is a

configuration cost

Ongoing GRC management is work - there is an

administration tax

Getting teams to utilize the tool is work - there is an

adoption cost

Upskilling users to leverage the tool is work - there is a

literacy tax

Integrating a new tool operationally is work - there is a

toolchain tax

(GRC = Governance, Risk, Compliance, basically enterprise concerns)

But why the delineation between costs vs taxes?

Costs are easy to explain but hard to reduce - you should do your best to manage

Taxes are easy to forget and painful to pay - you should do your best to eliminate

By the way, you can sometimes trade off up-front costs (e.g. structured setup as part of configuration) for future taxes (e.g. ongoing clean-up as part of administration) - there successful B2B products on both ends of the spectrum (although the trend seems to be reducing time / effort for the user to get up and running while tagging the lead / admin with more clean-up down the road).

And why should I care about this TCO framing?

Your job as a company is to reduce TCO from a prospect / customer perspective - you‚Äôre the better solution if and only if you can show that you‚Äôre lower TCO (if not immediately then over a reasonable time horizon so the ROI makes sense)

You need to think carefully about who eats costs / taxes as you reduce TCO - you can use a combination of R&D teams building products, GTM teams executing playbooks, and external players providing support to solve for this

tl;dr

you either deal with taxes or your product faces death‚Ä¶

As always, I‚Äôd also love to hear from readers on their attempts reduce TCO - please chime in via commentsüëá. And if you enjoyed this post, please consider subscribing.

Debt Relief for Product Teams,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/debt-relief-for-product-teams,"One of the strange realities of my life that I‚Äôve come to terms with is that Pandora serves me up non-stop debt relief commercials in between songs. My best guess as to why this is happening is that I‚Äôve broken their ad targeting algorithm through a combination of (a) 80s music playlists and (b) credit card signups. But after years of listening to such offers, I‚Äôve become very familiar with the formula for getting debt under control:

stop adding more

start consolidation

prioritize the list

find leverage points

make an actual dent

repeat until relief

And this approach is something that can be utilized by software teams to wrangle product / technology debt as well. Let me elaborate:

[1] Stop Adding More

The first rule is to simply stop chasing a moving target; prevent new debt from accruing. This means changing any behaviors (e.g. short-sighted architectures, one-off features, etc) that are continuing to increase the debt balance. If you can‚Äôt completely put a stop to the buildup then at least slow it down. All of this implies you have a mechanism to both measure debt overall and its accumulation. In addition to instrumentation, process is key to ensuring that any attempts to add more debt are discussed, with the additional benefit of just plain making it harder to do so by having to go through more hoops (i.e. the default path is to layer decisions to compound value vs aggravate debt).

[2] Start Consolidation

Once you have a (mostly) static pile of debt to clean up, you have to organize it into a consolidated list. Whatever your tool of choice, it‚Äôs critical that it simplify access and collaboration; managing debt on a product team involves the entire cross-functional group. You make it easy to add and drop things from the list because it needs to remain up-to-date and accurate; when there is the inevitable org change or talent transition, you don‚Äôt want to be reliant on triable knowledge to keep track of debt. Lastly, having the list in a tool ensures visibility (for sprint planning, for quarterly reviews, etc), which is key to alignment on how to tackle it.

[3] Prioritize the List

When it comes to prioritizing the list of debts, keep in mind that the goal is not only reduction in debt, but also what you can achieve once you‚Äôre free from it; you need a north star metric. Some of the more meaningful outcomes I‚Äôve seen teams achieve by shrinking debt are increasing feature velocity, reducing support costs, creating innovation bandwidth, accelerating delivery pace, and improving product quality. Once you know the end result you‚Äôre aiming for, stack ranking what debt you want to tackle first is a much simpler exercise - you may even realize your goal is not to get to 0, but rather just to a point where it‚Äôs no longer a hurdle to your larger business objectives.

[4] Find Leverage Points

As you start actually eliminating debt, it helps to model a dependency graph - you should be able to distinguish superficial debt from systemic debt. You can think of systemic debt as the root cause of multiple superficial debts - for example a legacy monolithic architecture results in service hotspots and dependency deadlock. With this framework, product teams can actually have a reasonable debate on whether to (a) start with low-hanging fruit (i.e. superficial debt) in the interest of building up the muscle or (b) go after higher ROI legacy issues (i.e. systemic debt) that take longer to address but builds a foundation. Getting more sophisticated on understanding debt also leads to conversations around creating multi-purpose services, building vs buying core infra, and end-of-life-ing rarely-used features.

[5] Make an Actual Dent

One of the biggest mental hurdles to overcome with debt is the feeling that it‚Äôs insurmountable - getting a ‚Äúwin‚Äù and starting to show progress is paramount. The visceral feeling of seeing a list of issues getting shorter helps keep people motivated to go after this type of work. There is actually an argument to be made that starting with low-complexity / low-value debt removal in the interest of getting a quick win is a sensible strategy, as it bootstraps the flywheel to a degree.

[6] Repeat Until Relief

Finally, debt management, like any other best practice, needs to be operationalized vs one-and-done. Reducing debt is an ongoing product team responsibility on the same level as feature delivery, and part of a balanced diet approach. Whatever an organization‚Äôs product development playbook is, it should weave in the 5 steps above throughout the lifecycle.

Deciding Free vs Paid in B2B Product Packaging,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/deciding-free-vs-paid-in-b2b-product,"Quick post today on a conversation I‚Äôve been having with some folks in my PM network: how do you decide what stays free vs gets paywalled in your B2B product?

There are of course many in-between monetization paths beyond just a binary free vs paid offering‚Ä¶options like freemium, trials, and services can all be the right lever for your product / motion. But I love frameworks and was very curious if there was a way to determine a path at the feature ideation phase, and today I heard a simple but clear framework for things that absolutely should be in free*

if it helps acquisition

if it helps activation

if it helps retention

* this is not to say that the full version of the feature has to be completely free - but you certainly want a usable, valuable version out there for the reasons above

Basically anything that starts or spins your flywheel‚Ä¶you want to get in front of as many users as possible. And if you have a feature that helps on multiple lifecycle levers, it‚Äôs likely a differentiator for your product; said another way, you should find ways to put a (possibly lightweight) version of your differentiators in your free plan.

I‚Äôm going to be noodling on this framework further, and possibly picking some B2B products in the market to pressure test whether this holds true.

As always, I‚Äôd also love to hear from readers about their decisions on what‚Äôs free vs paid in their product - please chime in via commentsüëá. And if you enjoyed this post, please consider subscribing.

Discerning Differentiators,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/discerning-differentiators,"Lately, my focus at the day job has been translating our annual plans into quarterly roadmaps for internal enablement and external broadcasting. This is pretty common practice at an enterprise SaaS company at the beginning of the year - sales kickoff, field training, partner updates, etc. What isn‚Äôt standardized across SaaS products is how to frame your roadmap for maximum impact. I‚Äôm basically referring to the storyboard of the roadmap slide deck. Here are various was I‚Äôve seen it assembled:

mirrors the org design of R&D (product / engineering / design) departments

bucketed by different product lines (SKUs) that sales / marketing position

oriented along pricing and packaging offerings (free / paid / premium)

tied to the tactics that ladder up to the product / GTM strategy (~ 12 mo horizon)

aligned around the broader company goals / business outcomes being driven

key differentiators that are the reasons buyers buy and users use your product

The last one is my default / favorite - if you can get it right, you have a roadmap storyboard that can last for a few years (or at until the next act of your company).

Over the last few years, I‚Äôve gotten to pressure test the ‚Äúdifferentiators‚Äù of many products through my own work, advising peers, and evaluating competition. There are 3 questions that make up my ‚Äúsniff test‚Äù for whether a set of differentiators are legit, and these can be applied to any type of product (doesn‚Äôt have to be enterprise SaaS).

Is it a

structural advantage

that‚Äôs not easy for a competitor to replicate?

Does it represent a

unique point of view

on how the market is evolving?

Is it

accurate (vs aspirational)

Disoriented Teams,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/disoriented-teams,"While listening to a podcast recently, I picked up the most random bit of trivia: the word orientation comes from The Orient (aka the East). In olden times (before product management, before SaaS, before even the cloud), when a traveler was lost, they situated themselves by confirming they knew which way east was; to be ‚Äúoriented‚Äù means to know where you are relative to your ultimate goal (The Orient).

to be ‚Äúoriented‚Äù means to know where you are relative to your ultimate goal

This got me thinking about how much time teams (product teams, marketing teams, etc) spend on goal management. Defining the goal, instrumenting the metric, forecasting the target, reviewing results. And an organizational leader expends a lot of energy agonizing about progress - do the bets ladder up to the goal, is the pace of execution efficient, is the team focused on the highest-leverage work. It‚Äôs almost like we‚Äôve convinced ourselves that optimizing the output of a team has the biggest impact on business outcomes.

But I think there‚Äôs even lower-hanging fruit that we tend to neglect: disoreinted teams. A disoriented team is one where there is no cohesive goal (doing a little bit of everything) or the focus is on the wrong goal (doesn‚Äôt connect to business strategy). As a leader, getting oriented teams to be more effective is definitely valuable, but getting disoriented teams re-oriented actually reduces a huge drag in the org.

So the next time you‚Äôre in a metrics review, beyond just confirming progress for the teams that are well-oriented, it might be worthwhile to spend some mindshare on teams that don‚Äôt know which way is east‚Ä¶

Eigenquestions as Answers,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/eigenquestions-as-answers,"Occasionally I will run across a great framework that sounds really useful, but then struggle to find an appropriate way to apply it in practice. One such framework in my back pocket was Eigenquestions (see link in further reading section). Basically an Eigenquestion is a domino question, the answer to which leads to a cascading series of decisions, both now and in the future. It sounds magical, I know, but I had yet to apply it even though I‚Äôd discovered it several years ago.

Fast forward to last week, when I was having a mentoring session with a PM in my network. This PM was struggling with an experiment, which hadn‚Äôt reached stat sig yet - further, he didn‚Äôt have hope that it would reach stat sig, because there was an opt in step to try out the new UX. He also had a stakeholder who was convinced (without data) that the change could negatively affect a tension metric, so now the team was stuck in a stalemate. We went in circles for a bit, debating reasons why the opt in had to be in place, where the stakeholder intuition came from, and whether to expand the target audience pool.

I asked whether the org cared more about confirming experiments had a positive lift, or avoiding decision deadlock. Because this 1 experiment debate was probably a microcosm of how decision making was dragged out in this org. And there it was, the Eigenquestion: do you value validation of impact or speed of iteration? This helped give the PM I was chatting with a framing for how to go have the conversation with his leadership team and unblock several other people in the org who were dealing with similar stalemates.

All this time I had been looking to apply the concept because it was intellectually interesting - but what I realized from this discussion was that an Eigenquestion makes sense when you‚Äôre trying to establish a principle. It‚Äôs a framing device for uncovering a latent principle, and principles are how you accelerate decision making.

When do you need an evergreen principle vs just a one-off answer?

when there is no data, conflicting data, or anecdata

when you are having a debate for the nth time

when the decision will have a cascading effect on follow-on decisions

when you‚Äôre starting an org from scratch

when you‚Äôre revisiting a long-standing ritual that‚Äôs atrophied

Enterprise Consumerization Entry,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/enterprise-consumerization-entry,"If you‚Äôve been following this newsletter since its inception, you‚Äôve picked up on my interest in the consumerization of enterprise software. After obsessing over

this Kevin Kwok blog post

for a while, I‚Äôm now dissecting this

Scott Belsky podcast episode

. It‚Äôs worth a listen, but I‚Äôll summarize my takeaways (and favorite quotes) on what it takes to tackle enterprise software with a consumer flair:

Surfaces Beat Services

Learning Isn‚Äôt Tolerated

Default to Multi Player

Everyone Walks First Mile

Progress Begets Progress

Let‚Äôs dive in!

[1] Surfaces Beat Services

The point of interaction (i.e. front office) is now the focus vs the point of integration (i.e. back office). By simplifying how work gets done by the user (or department), you can create a new entry-point into an enterprise; this was traditionally more a cross-departmental concern handled by IT, which looked for shared services. If your product abstracts away the complexity of underlying technology, you make the line of business you are catering to less reliant on centralized IT.

[2] Learning Isn‚Äôt Tolerated

Everyone is bringing their ‚Äúexpectations of elegance‚Äù that they‚Äôve picked up as a consumer to work, and software that requires a steep learning curve just doesn‚Äôt cut it anymore. Whether your UX goal is more intuitive or delightful or appealing, removing the learning curve goes a long way towards successful adoption and engagement.

[3] Default to Multi Player

Work happens collaboratively (vs individually), and the team is now the primary persona to build for. So much of enterprise software comes down to ‚Äúwall to wall‚Äù deployment strategy, both on the part of the buyer (change management) and seller (product adoption) - but if you think of teams (vs individuals) as the most atomic unit, that growth is modeled more easily and executed more predictably.

[4] Everyone Walks First Mile

All the onboarding funnels / adoption loops / inert flywheels have one thing in common: step 1. Every user at a minimum goes through the initial setup process, but the ‚Äúdevil is in the defaults‚Äù. By being more thoughtful and proactive about the bootstrap experience, you can save the customer a lifetime of pain, since those first choices tend to live forever.

[5] Progress Begets Progress

We‚Äôre in the era of ‚Äúego analytics‚Äù, where vanity metrics are used to nudge users into action. If you ‚Äúmerchandise progress‚Äù, you can lead lead folks not only to successful setup, but also healthy adoption. This is a bag of tricks well understood (and over employed) in consumer apps; in the enterprise, it can be leveraged to take users that are stuck in consumer mode (low utility, churn risk) towards creator behavior (high value, retention probability).

Enterprise SaaS Truisms,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/enterprise-saas-truisms,"Today‚Äôs post is short and sweet; I was thinking about opinions I‚Äôve formed about B2B SaaS offerings the last few years (as a builder, as an advisor, and as a user), and I wanted to share out just to see if they‚Äôre more widely held, obvious but true, totally counter-intuitive, or perhaps way off-base.

80/20 equilibrium

- getting your user base to an 80/20 split between consumers / creators is a good milestone (lots of successful products live at this ratio)

configuration is key

- no one has an issue with the software itself; their complaints are all about the way it‚Äôs implemented

shadow IT is real

- users have 10x more pull than IT and will go around any policies, rules, constraints that they can; enforcement is futile

usage begets sprawl

- the more you use it, the worse the experience gets, because power usage creates clutter, which hinders novice user adoption

admin is not a JTBD

- no user knows their admin, no admin knows they are an admin, and the SaaS vendor thinks the admin has no other jobs to do

change management is a barrier

- it follows a step function, with limited adoption in fits and spurts, then hits a tipping point (or plateaus)

ship dates are arbitrary

- how much a company cares about a release date is inversely proportional to how much the customer / user cares

inbox is the end goal

- wild success is being yet another inbox (email, chat, etc) and requires building all those features (search, notifications, snooze, archive)

‚Äúfit‚Äù changes the status quo

- product/market fit, market/motion fit, etc can only be achieved by either reducing effort via product (to meet user ability) OR increasing enablement via GTM (to meet market maturity)

80/20 paradox

- the majority of customers use a minority of features, but stickiness requires deeper implementation / engagement / integration

When it comes to product building, there is good fast and bad fast. 

Good fast focuses on the speed of decision making and execution. Good fast focuses on reducing scope while increasing quality.  

Bad fast just sacrifices quality.

The central thesis of our guest‚Äôs talk was simple:

decision-making is the root cause of all dysfunctions affecting an organization

He laid out a model for decision-making that still sticks with me, and I find it very useful in terms of framing, communicating, and aligning. There are fundamentally 3 types of decisions:

Type 1 - solo-driven

Type 2 - input-driven

Type 3 - collab-driven

Type 1

decisions are top-down. Someone with authority / autonomy to make a call just makes it. They have all the context needed to make the decision. They‚Äôve deemed debate on the decision unnecessary. The cognitive load to others is not worth it. The decision might be so simple that it‚Äôs quicker this way. All anyone needs to know is the decision has been made. (I know this sounds un-collaborative, that‚Äôs exactly the point).

Examples:

choosing whether to do a team strategy offsite (decider knows it‚Äôs overdue)

pre-announcing a feature to the market (decider knows PR vs. pressure tradeoff)

Type 2

decisions are plug-n-play.  The person on point to make the decision needs a bit of info that someone else can / should provide, so they get it and move on. There is some context provided on the request for info, but there‚Äôs not a whole lot of debate or lobbying. What folks need to know is their input will move the decision forward, but the decision is not theirs. (I know this sounds transactional, that‚Äôs exactly the point).

Examples:

making a hiring decision on a candidate (decider needs interview feedback)

picking a restaurant for a team lunch (decider needs dietary restrictions)

Type 3

decisions are chime-in. The person on point needs not only input, but subject matter expertise, across a variety of functions, to even position the decision. In fact, there might not even be a clear decider, and that might be the first order of business for a working group. What everyone needs to know is while there eventually needs to be a decision, deliberation and debate are worth the time investment. (I know this sounds open-ended, that‚Äôs exactly the point).

Examples:

investing in a new product line (market dynamics, competitors analysis, etc)

rolling back a change for service outage (root cause, customer impact, etc)

So how does this help?

dysfunction arises when the maker of the decision and the consumers of the decision are not on the same page on decision type

Think about it. A team argues that an offsite will be ‚Äútime away from work‚Äù while the manager knows that the team is spending time on low-leverage activities and needs a reset. An interview panelist lobbies to hire (or not hire) a candidate based on their amazing (terrible) 1 hour with the candidate, not realizing that the hiring manager has a 360 view across 8 hours of candidate feedback. A leader gets a group together to brainstorm ideas on how to tackle a new initiative and folks hesitate to speak up, waiting to hear a direction from the leader, not realizing the on-the-ground viewpoint they have is what the leader needs to hear.

So how can you apply this in practice, both as a decision-maker and decision-consumer?

start with clarity on who the decider is (and why)

frame decisions as type 1, 2, or 3 to pre-align folks

set context based on type 1 (little), 2 (more), or 3 (total)

Would love to hear from readers on their decision dysfunctions and whether this helps‚Ä¶

Exponential Hires,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/exponential-hires,"Hiring is probably my favorite way to spend my time professionally. The act of sourcing, selling, and securing talent is a great reminder of why you do what you do; you have to articulate your mission, highlight your strategy, align everyone‚Äôs abilities, and achieve multi-party buy-in over the course of a hire. There are tons of tips around recruiting best practices and hiring manager expectations I‚Äôll share in future posts, but today I wanted to highlight a term I keep in my back pocket when evaluating people:

exponential hires

.

It‚Äôs a concept I got from my first boss at Twitter, at a time when we were scaling rapidly (people, technology, process). We understood that we were hiring not just for specific roles, but in anticipation of the org needing to operate with 10x more complexity. As a reference point, the company was 500 people when I signed my offer and 700 when I started a couple of months later.

ibrahim

@ibscribe

@raffi

hey, did you coin ""exponential hire"" or did you hear / read that somewhere?

5:03 AM ‚àô Jan 22, 2015

Not every hire needs to fit this label, but certain situations warrant it. So when does it make sense to bring in exponential hires versus just qualified folks?

First Hire as a Newbie

- when you first start at a new company as a manager (or transition from individual contributor to manager at your existing company), one of your biggest moves is the talent you bring along

Team Bootstrap / Buildout

- when you‚Äôre creating a net-new team, the person that gets things rolling has a huge hand in establishing the norms of the group

Office Expansion / Site Lead

- when you‚Äôre expanding to a new locale, the site leader has to have the ability to both attract talent and craft culture

But what are the traits of an exponential hire? Here are some recurring characteristics:

Talent Magnet

- people gravitate towards this person or their career choices, and this shows up in # of referrals, new sourcing channels, more pipeline diversity

Change Agent

- this tends to be clearer in hindsight, but with some hires you can point to their arrival as the point of pivot (e.g. reliability stops being an issue)

Brand Booster

- you can establish your company as a player in whatever function (sales, product, engineering, design) by getting an industry expert via this hire

Bar Raiser

- when you bring in certain talent you almost reset what you expect going forward in a manager / leader because of their aptitude on that dimension

Ambition Creator

- your company‚Äôs appetite to tackle bigger bets goes up thanks to this person, likely because they have a track record of breaking asymptotes

Falling into a Feature Factory,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/falling-into-a-feature-factory,"I‚Äôve been mulling over recently how PMs end up working in a feature factory,

a term coined by former colleague John Cutler

. When PMs in my network ask me about my opinion on a role / company, whether it‚Äôs an environment where PMs can do interesting work with actual autonomy or whether it‚Äôs a ‚Äúfeature factory‚Äù tends to be part of the calculus. But no product team starts as a feature factory - most viable products start with a real customer problem and a differentiated insight that let‚Äôs them get traction in the market - so where along the way does the dysfunction emerge? What are the reasons PMs fall into a feature factory? And can you prevent your organization from heading in that direction?

My theory on how feature factories emerge is centered on the maker / manager split in most product development organizations; there are people who are focused on actually building products, and then others who are accountable for planning, orchestration, and ultimately impact. And when both groups are operating from their higher brain functions, delightful experiences can be created. But when one or both parties falls into a mode of just reacting from their ‚Äúreptilian brain‚Äù, things start to go sideways.

Let‚Äôs look at the manager side of things first, because feature factories tend to be a reflection on the quality of leaders. In an ideal environment, the leaders of an organization not only have same level of customer empathy and understanding as the folks who are directly interacting with them (sales, support, research, engineering), but also are able to layer in their market understanding, pattern patching, scaling experience, etc in order to create a coherent strategy. But there are factors that can knock leaders off kilter and lead them down the path of a feature factory.

First, the time horizon on which you operate dictates what part of your brain you utilize. When you have ample time, yours plans and execution tend to be more thought through in terms of dependencies, risks, communication, etc. But when you‚Äôre operating in an emergency mode with a heightened sense of immediacy (i.e. from your reptilian brain), you start to make quick decisions with limited deliberation to just survive. And in many product development organizations, there is time pressure that leaders are constantly reacting to: executive reviews that need status updates, investor updates that need meaningful progress, press cycles that need major announcements, contract renewals that need upsell features, and many more rote rituals that shift the mindset to short-term thinking. When you live quarter to quarter and move from firedrill to firedrill, your lizard brain is indeed your best survival mechanism.

Beyond the operating timeline, the manner in which decisions get made is also a strong indicator of feature factory potential. When decision makers get to be too many and decision criteria get to be too fluid, the net effect on the day to do day makers in the product / design / engineering organization is every individual for themselves, horse trading between teams to get anything done, ultimatums from executives to compensate for demotivation, and finally attrition of critical talent that knows it can find a better environment for doing their best work. The diffusion of accountability on decisions, both in terms of getting made and having impact, leads to the best informed employees feeling the most sidelined; the reactionaries take over the organization and proactive planners have a hard time adjusting.

The last and most egregious dysfunction that leaders can introduce is a lack of rigor. When company executives are not crisp on what customer segments to focus on or which market dynamics to lean into, that trickles down to teams, which end up playing games with metrics and focusing on outputs over outcomes. When there‚Äôs no clarity on building something differentiated, you get a bunch of roadmap items that just mimic the competition. The focus shifts to getting things done by a date vs asking whether the thing is worth doing at all. All teams are treated as a unified resource pool instead of semi-autonomous units with their own unique sliver of understanding of the  problem space and potential for outsized impact. And because there was no verification of demand to begin with, when random product ideas are brought to market and fail to get traction, the blame game begins across department horizontally, and up and down the org chart vertically.

Now, what about the makers? Are they just pawns while managers scheme? No, they are also legitimate actors, not just cogs in the feature factory machine. They too have the potential to utilize their entire mental faculties instead of over-relying on their reptilian brains. Just because the roadmap is snapshotted and communicated quarterly, doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt plan multi-quarter features (i.e. compound bets). Just because executives want the impact of product investments to be articulated as a function of revenue, doesn‚Äôt mean you have to make revenue your north star. Just because most rituals are about launches, doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt create new ones focused on landings. Just because the sales team is fixated on the launch of the new feature, doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt educate them on the value that already exists in the portfolio. Ultimately, for PMs to get the types of high-leverage, learning reps required to move into a leadership role, they have to get comfortable with saying no, slowing down, and thinking vs reacting. You have to control your lizard brain reactions to pressure from execs and move the discussion to a higher order part of your brain function.

I‚Äôve tried to outline the most common reptilian reactions and side effects that precede a feature factory, along with some course corrections, in the table below:

From Daily Decisions to Bottom Line,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/from-daily-decisions-to-bottom-line,"Readers of this newsletter know I love to delve into the topic of connecting product work to revenue, so when I was asked to speak at

ProductCon in New York

last week, I expanded on this framework I‚Äôve shared before:

The quick summary of this model is [1] executives / investors care about the KPIs of the business, but they are lagging indicators which are hard to evaluate so you need to introduce [2] strategic levers as a mechanism for creating leverage to move those KPIs, which ideally serve as the pillars of your R&D / GTM investment and also help you organize and hold teams accountable, ultimately connecting to [3] north star metrics that teams own and drive and utilize for prioritization and trade-off decisions because they are leading indicators.

The piece I added for my ProductCon talk, given that the PMs in the audience were looking for practical, actionable advice, was a breakdown of the operationalization tree (i.e. what does it take to put this mindset into practice and what are best practices / anti patterns).

Specifically, when you are trying to connect product work to revenue, you end up having to deal with:

multiple dimensions of revenue (generation, preservation, sustainability)

an incomplete picture of the user / buyer journey regarding monetization

the desire for a single, simple metric that is easy to track and report on

the need to should a correlation between user behavior and monetization

the tension between monitoring output as a proxy for eventual outcomes

In terms of best practices, that means:

using the laddering mechanism outlined above to tell a metric connection story

making trade offs and choosing what aspect of revenue matters most now

looking at both quantitative and qualitative signals to enrich the story

picking metrics that are good enough vs trying to find the perfect metric

supporting the organization by not orienting on complex, compound metrics

building morale by showing a team can control the movement of a metric

creating rituals to not only report on the metric but understand drivers as well

When things go sideways, we see the following anti patterns:

treating revenue as the actual direct metric that a product team is accountable for

trying to show a single hop between feature development and revenue generation

‚Äúpeanut buttering‚Äù by refusing to make a priority call between revenue dimensions

treating one-off anecdotes as representative of the majority customer journey

over-engineering metrics by trying to include every dimension in an uber-metric

making it difficult for the organization to dissect and refine a north star metric

letting ‚Äúorphan‚Äù teams that don‚Äôt tie to strategy / outcomes persist as investments

One of the more interesting and evolving discussions in PM circles in 2024 was around the future and fate of the role given the emergence of AI-based tools that automate a lot of mundane tasks as well as

comments about the necessity of the role made by industry leaders

. These conversations went in many directions, including talk of converging the inbound (design + development) and outbound (distribution + monetization) aspects of the PM role.

My personal view is that truly building delightful experiences that significantly address customer pain in a way that leads to commercial success and business impact is a very complex job, and that job can be split up in many different ways across PM and other functions. The

evolving definition of product management

and people‚Äôs reactions to that transition is not a new topic; there is no right or wrong setup as far as I‚Äôm concerned, there is only the model that works for your company and scales with it.

But I was intrigued enough by the chatter to reach out to

Aatir Abdul Rauf from Behind Product Lines

for a discussion on PM/PMM collaboration, since that is a topic he frequently writes and shares about. As we talked, we realized there were many, many facets to the PM/PMM partnership that we could delve into, but one that we were both keen to explore was product launches‚Ä¶and how they go sideways. In the video above we each go through our top 5 mistakes that we‚Äôve seen - you can watch the recording (< 30 minutes) to get the full top 10 list, but in this post I wanted to recap some of the recurring themes that cut across these issues.

To start with, the biggest undercurrent of sub-optimal collaboration between PM and PMM is the fact that, well, they don‚Äôt actually collaborate a lot of times. In many organizations PM gets the product to a point where it can be released, and then PMM takes care of the launch and subsequent steps. This sequential operating model results in a disjointed narrative on several dimensions: target audience, monetization path, distribution channels, competitive positioning, differentiated capabilities, enablement story, and success metrics. Ideally, the why behind a product, the who it‚Äôs for, and the how of winning in the market is a consistent (albeit iterative) talk track from inception to launch. And in order for PM and PMM to be coherent in their storytelling to their respective stakeholders, they need to be reading from the same script - in fact, they need to have co-authored that script together. If such a partnership exists, then things like aligning objectives and sharing goals becomes much more possible.

A big part of joint storytelling is managing the narrative, both internally and externally - and multiple mistakes in our top 10 list are a byproduct of mismanagement of the narrative, either with internal stakeholders or external customers. A simple example is dropping the ball on sales enablement (either the content or delivery) to a degree that different reps are pitching different versions of the same product in their prospect meetings. Or not anticipating competitor response and having FAQs and battlecards ready. While enablement has tiers of details - the technical detail you go into with a professional services team that configures your product is deeper than what you share with your demo engineers - there has to be a steel thread of a story that spans all the launch collateral. Again, this is ensured by PM and PMM being collaborators early and often vs doing a hard hand off weeks before launch with things falling through the cracks.

With the acknowledgement that the messaging is told and retold in different channels and varying formats comes the realization that the message may not apply to all stakeholders and customers; meaning, not every feature is intended for 100% of your user base. In fact, your customer list is probably not a homogeneous group - there are different cohorts who signed up at different times for different reasons, and their appetite for the newly launched features may vary drastically. This is another root cause we covered - namely the attempts to push launches broadly that should be more targeted and tailored - it‚Äôs not only a waste of time and resources to go broad when you don‚Äôt need to, it also tends to not land as intended. If you‚Äôve had a PMM involved with a product since the business case stage or if you‚Äôve got a PM who understands the market segmentation, you can prevent such miscues well in advance.

Assuming you have a relevant announcement for a primed audience, another issue that crops up is the focus on features vs workflows. From a customer point of view, and even a sales rep‚Äôs perspective, the important part is not what the product can do but rather how it fits into the larger job to be done (JTBD). And too many launches don‚Äôt contextualize the customer problem - they just hype the solution without context. In order to explain why your product is the right solution, you have to first demonstrate an understanding of the problem, ideally in the customer‚Äôs own parlance. Too many companies explain products in their own internal jargon instead of meeting the customer where they are. If you can bridge that translation gap, getting your point across on differentiation becomes more viable. This also prevents obvious issues like a launch that‚Äôs missing must-have functionality - when PM and PMM are well versed in the customer workflow and user JTBD, there‚Äôs less likelihood of an incomplete solution that falls flat in the market.

Check out the video for the full top 10 list of blunders, and keep an eye out for future posts on the partnership between PM and PMM. Wherever you are in your product launch journey, you can apply the learnings from this discussion to your product today - again, if you have questions or want to continue the discussion, join the discussion via the Slack community or Substack chat!

¬øHappy Customers or Healthy Scorecards?,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/happy-customers-or-healthy-scorecards,"Note: today‚Äôs post was co-authored by 2 CSM friends (

Divya Gupta

and

Jordan Robinson

)

Readers of this newsletter know I‚Äôm a big fan of product folks as cross-functional shepherds; over the past few years, as I‚Äôve worked in enterprise SaaS, I‚Äôve learned that CSMs are a great spiritual partner for PMs. The reason for this is because both roles ultimately care about the same thing:

customer value

. And while they might utilize slightly different lenses (user engagement, account health), they have a shared belief that without customer value, there is only a fast path to churn (both user- and account- wise).

A CSM (or customer success manager) is a critical GTM role, usually rolling up to a C-level leader like a Chief Customer Officer or a Chief Revenue Officer. The roles and responsibilities of the job vary by company, but it usually centers around the successful adoption of the product, with an eye towards renewal (and ideally expansion). The largest enterprises tend to have a named CSM contact, while smaller segments like mid-market may have 1 CSM peanut-buttered across many accounts. In terms of org design, CSMs could be mapped by region in addition to segment. CSMs are definitely in the mix once a deal is signed, but some work during pre-sales with prospects as well in the interest of continuity. Given the plethora of issues that can get in the way of successful adoption (internal champions, organizational maturity, change management, technical expertise), a CSM can end up partnering with everyone from sales engineering to account reps to professional services. But ultimately, CSMs care about customers getting value for their spend, as quickly and with as little effort as possible.

As mentioned earlier, CSMs and PMs are very aligned on how they view the customer. The highest-leverage CSM can be a ‚Äútrusted advisor‚Äù for the customer, while the most-impactful PMs are fluent in ‚Äúcustomer voice‚Äù - these are 2 sides of the same coin. And both roles are motivated to generate customer impact. I‚Äôve written plenty before about how PM impact can be gauged, but for CSMs, incentive structures can range from carrying expansion quota to churn prevention commission. And as with any incentive structure, agreeing on a unit of measurement is key. While CSMs spend tons of time with customers getting influencer access, building joint success plans, game planning process changes, and running business reviews, there is one artifact that is becoming a standard part of the toolkit: a health scorecard.

But scorecards elicit mixed reactions from the CSM community. Some find them to be an indispensable resource, while others view them as a useless over-simplification. Let‚Äôs talk through both points of view.

For those that see scorecards as worthwhile, they are a tool to combine the product and GTM views of the customer lifecycle. A unified picture can highlight where customers are spending cycles and identify the points of leverage. And interesting insights arise when you blend product and account metrics. While proponents acknowledge that scorecards aren‚Äôt a silver bullet, they can be handy in validating (or challenging) prevailing sentiment - no framework is perfect, but scorecards can help surface where the model lacks signal. Further, there are function-specific reasons to have scorecards instituted as well - if CSM teams are broken out by market / segment, scorecards are one way to evaluate the performance of a pod (or perhaps the complexity of the customer slice they support). If certain pods‚Äô scorecards skew more healthy, their approach can be distilled into best practices and a playbook for other regions and segments. And finally, there will always be accounts (low revenue / high touch) where operationally it makes sense to use scorecards as a prerequisite to CSM intervention.

But scorecards have drawbacks and detractors as well. For starters, boiling things down to GREEN / RED distorts the complexity on the ground. GREEN is misleading because many accounts tragically go from GREEN to churned with no warning. And RED is unactionable because the reasons are so nuanced and customer-specific. Just the maintenance of the scorecards is an operational burden for someone in the CSM org, not to mention the initial investment to set up and roll out. For those that have been through a scorecard implementation, they‚Äôve seen either models that are too simple to be useful or too complex to comprehend. The approach also feeds the meme that the CSM role is in place for reactive help vs proactive guidance, which incentivizes CSMs to avoid churn vs nurture expansion...but this is counter to how sales teams (a recurring CSM partner) operate, which see an $

X

expand as orders of magnitude easier than a new $

X

land. To make matters worse, bad health scores don‚Äôt always correlate to churn, so the tool isn‚Äôt ideal for its intended purpose. And finally, there‚Äôs a bit of Goodhart‚Äôs law in play, where CSMs (or their management team) can start managing to the metric, ignoring the reality that true customer success requires a qualitative, account-level, deep dive.

So where does that leave scorecards?

Ultimately, any attempt to understand the customer picture has utility, but like any instrument, if over-used or mis-used, it can be counter-productive. And while there is no substitute for the sentiment of a plugged-in CSM, scaling that level of hands-on engagement across a customer base is costly. The domain of customer health is still nascent, so we‚Äôre all looking forward to the toolbox evolving.

In today‚Äôs episode I welcome

Neha Mittal

, a growth expert who‚Äôs worked on multiple large-scale consumer products (Twitter and Pinterest). As folks know, I love to

revisit Twitter and what could have been

. In this session we cover how growth strategies have evolved from the systematic experimentation era to today's AI-driven approaches. Note my conversation with Neha is very focused on consumer growth strategy - if you are curious about growth thinking for B2B products, check out my prior session with

Shahzad Shaikh

where

he talks about PLG and his experience as Head of Growth at Asana

.

We started the discussion with an overview of the user lifecycle and how it‚Äôs used to organize most growth teams at consumer companies.

We then talked about Twitter specifically and how an architecture that had been designed for massive scale supported the strategy of the growth team. The interoperability of different services enabling the growth team to get programmatic signals without much engineering work was a big unlock, and something that contrasts with the silos in many other product organizations. In fact, one reason why tension emerges between core product and growth teams at B2B companies is the inability for growth to get access to feature usage data without owning feature design and delivery.

One of the transitions Neha observed on Twitter‚Äôs growth team during her tenure was a move from experiment-driven to intuition-driven. Rather than pick one over the other, in the clip below Neha highlights when it makes sense to operate in each mode.

From there we delved into how AI is emerging as an asset for growth teams. One angle Neha highlights is content - both easier content generation and better content relevance.

But the meta takeaway about using AI tools in your growth stack is the ability to now make meaning out of unstrucured data. In the snippet below, we talk about utilizing AI to identify segments for personalization purposes. This is in contrast to the prior generation of tools, which relied on growth PMs / marketers to create cohorts based on structured user attributes - now user behavior can be modeled at a level of precision and matched with a level of relevance unheard of at consumer scale before (at least without an army of data scientists).

Over the course of our time together, we hit on several other aspects of at-scale growth strategy and emerging AI tools, including:

how Twitter‚Äôs approach to growth changed after the acquisition by Elon Musk

One of the practices mentioned is a learning backlog. I‚Äôve been doing a version of this for the last several years, and I wanted to share what I‚Äôve found to be a powerful routine.

We all (occasionally) have product intuition. But we end up not following through because‚Ä¶reasons.

the market timing isn‚Äôt right

the team staffing isn‚Äôt there

you can‚Äôt

quite

articulate value

there is a lack of data to +1 it

I call these product hunches. Something (a customer conversation you had, a design review you attended, an analyst report you read, a JIRA comment you saw, etc) put the seed of an idea in your head. And while you may downplay it in the immediate-term, one of your jobs as a PM is to come back to it in the long-term. And what I‚Äôm proposing is a structured mechanism to revisit these half-formed ideas.

I‚Äôve posted previously about

writing things down

so that you can circle back when the moment is right. The specific technique I use I picked up from

Steven Johnson

. Basically, it‚Äôs a ‚ÄúHunch Tracker‚Äù - every time an idea pops into my head, I add it to a long-running Google Doc. Every new idea is added to the top of the doc (just a quick tl;dr), along with the date plus some context on what sparked it (it‚Äôs a very simple journal entry). Once a quarter (you can pick your own cadence) I comb through the doc in chronological order (so from bottom to top), and this is where the magic happens‚Ä¶

The ideas start connecting when you read them as one, long, narrative thread. Fully-formed concepts emerge from disparate bits and pieces, like portions of your subconscious coming to the forefront of your brain. The key parts of this process are cataloging potential bets in one place and actually making time to review.

So try it out. Would love to hear about readers‚Äô attempts at ‚Äúhunch tracking‚Äù and what dots started connecting from them‚Ä¶

Illuminating Product Strategy,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/illuminating-product-strategy,"‚ÄúWe‚Äôre looking for a head of product‚Ä¶‚Äù

I get a lot of messages that start this way. So when I saw one in my Twitter DMs last week, I started composing my usual response. But as I was typing, another DM came through‚Ä¶

‚Äú‚Ä¶but not you.‚Äù

I paused. A series of messages from a former colleague came through, asking for advice in her current situation. She‚Äôs part of the leadership team at an enterprise SaaS startup, and while they have an active search for a head of product, the exec team is actively mis-aligned on why. She explained that there were 2 camps forming:

group A believed the company had a clear product strategy, and they needed to hire a seasoned operator to just execute it

group B believed the company actually lacked a coherent product strategy, and they needed to hire a clear thinker to define it

Her request to me was simple:

‚Äúdo you have any insightful questions that would illuminate the product strategy, or lack thereof?‚Äù

Did I!

I immediately launched into a 3-part answer (side note:

it‚Äôs always a 3-part answer

).

clear problem‚Ä¶for which the product was a solution

clear user‚Ä¶for whom the problem was worth solving

clear metric‚Ä¶by which the value swap was measured

Wait‚Ä¶did that answer her question? Or did I just share a factoid that I like reciting? (future topic / pet peeve: interviewees who answer questions with aphorisms like this).

My framing helped answer whether there was a viable product, but it didn‚Äôt do much to clarify what, if any, product strategy existed. I thought a bit more about my favorite ways to ‚Äúpressure test‚Äù strategy for enterprise SaaS products:

what is your primary customer acquisition channel?

can your go-to-market team explain product value?

what levers drive user adoption / account growth?

how does product usage tie to a buying decision?

can your target customer quantify purchase ROI?

do you have a filter for saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to feature asks?

is the core motion distilled into a primary loop?

are market timing and behavior trends on your side?

If you can answer all these, then in my opinion not only do you have a product strategy, but it‚Äôs also aligned from a cross-functional perspective. I haven‚Äôt heard back yet, but my hope is this line of thinking helped bring groups A and B together.

I‚Äôd love to hear from readers about the different ways they craft and confirm strategy - please chime in via commentsüëá. And if you enjoyed this post, please consider¬†subscribing.

Implementing Product Strategy,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/implementing-product-strategy,"The most unexpected (and my favorite) byproduct of this newsletter has been the serendipitous conversations stemming from reader comments. And one recently asked me to think beyond just crafting product strategy and talk through ‚Äúoperationalization‚Äù. The below is our (cleaned up) email exchange, where I lay out all the ways strategy doesn‚Äôt stick in an organization.

there is no strategy (i.e. you just list out business targets or feature ideas)

there is no standard way to document or iterate on strategy

there is a strategy but it's mis-aligned across functional pillars

there is a desire to iterate on the strategy because (planned / unplanned) event

there is a strategy but it's not well documented or disseminated

there is  a strategy but it‚Äôs unclear which roadmap items move the needle

there are gaps in the roadmap when compared against the strategy

the costs (people, infrastructure) of executing the strategy are unclear

there is a need to assess how an investment (or divestment) fits the strategy

a product idea needs to be pressure tested against the strategy (yes or no, ROI)

there is work underway that doesn't map to the strategy

the strategy is not producing the desired results (and in the desired timeframe)

it‚Äôs unclear how well employees / partners  understand the strategy

the strategy needs to be shared beyond the product team (GTM, analysts, board)

there needs to be a retrospective on the strategy and business outcomes

a decision / trade-off needs to be revisited to ensure it was aligned strategically

multiple strategic alternatives need to be compared before picking a path

the strategy needs to be looked at from a competitor‚Äôs point of view

That‚Äôs almost ~ 20 things that could be going awry as you attempt to implement a product strategy. How do you make sense of it all?

All of these issues can be traced back to 2 key concepts:

legibility - how clearly is the strategy articulated

synchronicity - how swiftly does action follow strategy

I‚Äôm borrowing (and expanding) these concept from Kevin Kwok; he uses them to describe systems, particularly people organizations. In other words, when it comes to product strategy, how you communicate it to people and how you align people dictate whether you‚Äôll successfully be able to implement.

With legibility, you have to utilize different mediums (docs, slides, wikis, flyers) and channels (all hands, 1:1‚Äôs, offsites, QBR‚Äôs). Repetition is key, and effective executives understand how often and through which means to repeat until the strategy is absorbed.

With synchronicity, you have to leverage operational scaffolding (OKRs, planning cycle, product roadmap) and incentive structures (compensation, recognition, scope). Buy-in is critical, and successful leaders know how to line up the organization for smooth execution.

Legibility and Synchronicity (along with Composability and Affordability) are the 4 dimensions of a coherent strategy (see visual below and link in further reading).

Imposter Syndrome / Product Vision,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/imposter-syndrome-product-vision,"""Excellence is mundane. Superlative performance is really a confluence of dozens of small skills or activities, each one learned or stumbled upon, which have been carefully drilled into habit and then are fitted together in a synthesized whole. There is nothing extraordinary or superhuman in any one of those actions; only the fact that they are done consistently and correctly, and all together, produce excellence.""

Today‚Äôs post is a bit backwards, in that I shared a quick thought on LinkedIn earlier this week that seemed to resonate with a lot of people, so I‚Äôm sharing some longer form thoughts here (usually I share nuggets from my newsletter articles on LinkedIn after publishing).

We all suffer from imposter syndrome at work - one of the biggest instances for me when switching into PM was ""product vision"" - I had a hard time keeping up with folks who would just rapid-fire toss out product ideas and debate pros/cons in a brainstorming session. (I much prefer to spend some time forming my thoughts, writing them down, and iterating on my point of view vs jumping in off-the-cuff.)

The biggest learning for me on this front has been realizing that folks with ""instincts"" are just keen observers of user behavior + business drivers + market trends, and that is a skill that can be acquired.

User Behavior

I‚Äôve shared before that products are workflows, and the biggest reason to observe and absorb user behavior is to comprehend the workflow as it exists (vs how your product would like it to exist). Some techniques for wrapping your head around user behavior:

use the product!

watch users use the product live / recorded (qual)

analyze user behavior with data science lens (quant)

read feature requests

Business Drivers

Software purchases are not solely determined by user behavior - much of buyer motivation comes from trying to solve business problems and drive outcomes. The best way I‚Äôve found to understand purchase behavior is to talk to the folks involved in the sales / success cycle.

talk to customers

talk to prospects

talk to GTM folks who interact with customers (sales, success, consulting)

Market Trends

The hardest part of crafting a product vision is pinning down what emerging trends are here to stay vs flash-in-the-pan. I find blending long-term forecasts with short-term results is a good method for separating signal from noise.

read analyst reports

read win / loss reports

As I've been mentoring PMs (and other functions) in my network recently, I'm hearing from a lot of people who are having a career crisis - folks have hit a wall and aren't just looking for a new job, but also a new approach to work. You can check out one flavor of these discussion in the comments section of

my recent LinkedIn post

.

Folks have heard me reference

invisible asymptotes

before, but usually in the context of product plateaus. Today I‚Äôm going to stretch the idea to encompass career plateaus. Because what‚Äôs happening for a lot of PMs is that they‚Äôre bumping into an invisible ceiling that was always there but not obvious because they were in an environment where rising tides were lifting all boats. But now, with a lot of companies under pressure performance-wise, the career growth that felt free flowing is harder to come by.

As I tend to do, I started enumerating the feelings of career constriction I was hearing:

job takes up 110% of mental bandwidth, no time for anything else

network is homogeneous, everyone I know is doing the same hustle

job mates are clones of me, so not learning from peer group

job emphasizes functional expertise, no room for x-functional learning

learning beyond core role not encouraged (because time, budget, etc)

have a diverse network but not sure who's an expert in what domain

have network and resources, but can't structure a learning / growth plan

learned a lot, but don't know how to showcase it / tell my story broadly

After some public iteration on these symptoms of careers stalling, I‚Äôve arrived at the root causes below. Going back to the invisible asymptotes concept, when you‚Äôre tackling a problem, it‚Äôs important to tug on the thread of immediate problems until you find the ultimate problem. When I‚Äôm serving as a sounding board for PMs in a career crisis, I tend to hear phrases like ‚Äúmy boss doesn‚Äôt care about my career growth‚Äù or ‚Äúthis place is a just a feature factory‚Äù - these are all valid issues, but my mind tends to jump to solutioning, which requires control of the problem, which is why I prefer to frame them more as issues that are within your power to affect.

Bandwidth - don‚Äôt have time to think

Network - don‚Äôt have connections

Mentorship - don‚Äôt get guidance

Learning - don‚Äôt get to expand skills

Storytelling - don‚Äôt know how to brand

Opportunity - don‚Äôt know options

I‚Äôve turned this list of ‚Äúsoft‚Äù ceilings that can combine to make you feel like you‚Äôve hit a ‚Äúhard‚Äù ceiling into a visual, which you can share on

LinkedIn

or

Twitter

.

To go one step further, I‚Äôll highlight what this looks like in conversation with fragments I hear while mentoring PMs.

Bandwidth - don‚Äôt have time to think

‚ÄúI‚Äôm already spending every waking moment on my day job.‚Äù

‚ÄúI feel so burned out, I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôd do a job search.‚Äù

‚ÄúI get pinged all the time, but nothing looks that interesting.‚Äù

Network - don‚Äôt have connections

‚ÄúEveryone I know is struggling in the same space as me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to break into <new domain> but don‚Äôt know anyone.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been learning <new domain> but need someone to give me a shot.‚Äù

Mentorship - don‚Äôt get guidance

‚ÄúEveryone else in my product org is complaining about the same stuff.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy manager only cares about hitting our ship dates, not my growth.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve tried to get outside mentors but it usually ends after 1 courtesy call.‚Äù

Learning - don‚Äôt get to expand skills

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just doing more and more of the same - I‚Äôve been pigeonholed.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe use to have learning budget, but not anymore, so I‚Äôm stuck.‚Äù

‚ÄúOur product domain is so niche, I don‚Äôt want to be an expert in this.‚Äù

Storytelling - don‚Äôt know how to brand

‚ÄúI feel like there are so many strong PMs looking right now.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm having a hard time coming up big wins for my resume.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve done so many random roles, recruiters can‚Äôt place me.‚Äù

Opportunity - don‚Äôt know options

‚ÄúWhat if the grass isn‚Äôt greener? And I leave just to come back?‚Äù

‚ÄúI never get picked to do the cutting edge stuff, like AI projects.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think taking this role has put my career in a dead end.‚Äù

These conversations got me thinking about why people hit these ceilings and what can be done preemptively to find and nurture future opportunities before you desperately need to exercise them.

In

my last post

I outlined the plateaus that many PMs hit career-wise, including the reasons behind those invisible ceilings. The whole discussion started with

this LinkedIn post

which garnered a lot of responses.

In this part 2, I‚Äôd like to talk through some of the ways PMs can re-assert agency and re-direct their careers in the direction they want. A lot of the ideas I‚Äôll cite are ones I‚Äôve articulated before, but in this post I‚Äôm going to connect these solutions back to the root problems enumerated above.

A lot of career stagnation comes down to not getting reps at doing new things (

‚Äúdon‚Äôt get to expand skills‚Äù

) - the path through that is to develop and exercise product judgement. The main reason why many PMs shy away from getting into the fray is a feeling of imposter syndrome. The biggest learning for me on this front has been realizing that folks with good ""instincts"" are just keen observers of user behavior + business drivers + market trends, and that is a skill that can be acquired.

The next bit of advice I‚Äôll offer is to NOT get caught up in the mechanics of a career ladder. Many PMs try to take a paint-by-numbers approach in climbing the ladder (

‚Äúdon‚Äôt get guidance‚Äù

), almost treating it like a checklist. But in my view the different levels of product management are about the mode you‚Äôre operating in - in order to progress, you have to operate in a new mode vs operating in your current mode more efficiently.

If a PM is actually demonstrating operating ability at the next level, then it becomes a storytelling exercise (

‚Äúdon‚Äôt know how to brand‚Äù

). Your direct manager / management chain have to construct a narrative of what you‚Äôve done, how you‚Äôve done it, and why now is the moment to celebrate that milestone.

But a lot of PMs are so caught up in the day-to-day execution of shipping features and making fixes that they can‚Äôt think proactively about career management (

‚Äúdon‚Äôt have time to think‚Äù

). In fact, in many product organizations, there is more PM

competition

than

collaboration

. And that‚Äôs usually because the company overall isn‚Äôt aligned and organized around a coherent strategy. Ironically, in order for a PM to have an easier time executing, they need to spend time aligning leadership and teams up-front and semi-regularly. There are 4 dimensions to a coherent strategy: legibility, synchronicity, composability, and affordability. And attempting to straighten out such gaps provides exactly the kind of reps you need to climb the ladder.

Part of the challenge with PM roles, and all functions, is that your growth as a leader requires you to focus less within your department and operate more cross-functionally; the highest-leverage work at any company spans departments. The lack of growth opportunities in some ways is a lack of visibility for PMs across functions (

‚Äúdon‚Äôt have connections‚Äù

). This is compounded by the paradox that unlike other roles (sales, marketing, engineering, support) there is not a direct correlation to an output metric for a PM; more salespeople is more deals, more marketing is more pipeline, more engineering is more code, more support is less tickets‚Ä¶but more PMs is what exactly? To me, the answer is leverage, which I‚Äôve laid out in my product leadership principles (

see here for the full version

).

iteration ¬ª ideation

system ¬ª sections

foundation ¬ª features

synthesis ¬ª status

outcomes ¬ª output

sustainable ¬ª sporadic

fluidity ¬ª firmness

planning ¬ª plans

quality ¬ª quickness

proxies ¬ª process

direction ¬ª data

loops ¬ª leaps

writing ¬ª winging

But even if you‚Äôre doing everything I‚Äôve shared above, you might still have hit a wall in your current company which you can‚Äôt see past (

‚Äúdon‚Äôt know options‚Äù

). This is where thinking beyond the traditional definition of product might be the unlock. While trading emails with someone in my network (I was asking what is interesting but missing content for PM learning) I was presented with this gem:

‚ÄúGenerally I think there is an important trend going on, where a product is no longer just software. SaaS products consist of software, data, human input, APIs, integrations, etc. So the definition of ‚Äòproduct‚Äô is changing. Product managers need to see this. They need to think broadly about the product although they are in their work trying to define it narrowly.‚Äù

I love this line of thinking, because it jives with many of my opinions (and biases) about the craft of product management. And it‚Äôs also a reminder that new opportunities materialize when you choose to widen your aperture and take a more comprehensive look at the problem from a customer perspective; you have to redefine your product‚Äôs scope - no one else has the context or vision to do that for you. This mindset shift is the key to finding your way through the ambiguity that is at the heart of product building / market capture.

It's the Silence that Suffocates,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/its-the-silence-that-suffocates,"note: this is not one of my usual posts - it might be uncomfortable to read - it was to write‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs been over a week since I wrote / published anything; like many folks, I‚Äôve been processing the images of systemic racism and police brutality against black people on full display in the US. If we‚Äôre being honest, we‚Äôve gone through such cycles before - unbelievable event, righteous outrage, guilt-ridden support, and superficial progress. It eventually quiets down through a combination of token reforms and collective exhaustion. Eventually, most of society says, ‚Äúyeah, that‚Äôs good enough for now.‚Äù

Will there be meaningful change this time? Were prior changes meaningless?

I don‚Äôt have any of those answers. After much thought and reflection, I‚Äôve come to the realization that the only thing 100% in your control is your own actions. To be clear, I do believe in policy, law, organization, education, etc. And I love seeing folks using their money, time, and voice to advance the cause on those axes. But at the end of the day, your behavior when no one else is watching is what you should be most accountable for (vs. your behavior when the world is watching). And with that in mind, I wanted to share a story that has been replaying in my mind for the last 20 years‚Ä¶

At my first real job out of college, I was very involved with university recruiting (just a few months out of grad school) and onboarding new hires (recent experience for me). I really enjoyed it. Selling folks who had 1-2 semesters ago been my peers to join our mission was a good 20% project, a side gig to balance out the day-to-day rigors of writing code. I was on at least 1 panel a week, and every interview had a group debrief as a best practice.

One week, we had a candidate onsite. I did the welcome tour in the AM and handed her off to the first interviewer. Another engineer and I had lunch with her and did ‚Äúculture evaluation‚Äù (which was code for would we as an engineering team regularly want to grab lunch with this person). Throughout my day I would bump into interview panelists and we would flash a quick ‚Äúthumbs up‚Äù to each other, all of us feeling like she was flying through the day smoothly. At the end of the day, we walked her out and told her we‚Äôd be in touch. Then we all huddled up to compare notes and make a decision.

The roundtable went great at first. She had done really well on writing psudeocode, explaining technical design, troubleshooting bugs, and peer collaboration. No one had any concerns technically or culturally. The hiring manager had heard all they needed - we were going to move forward with an offer. The meeting was about to wrap, when a very senior leader said

‚Äúwhat‚Äôs with her hair? doesn‚Äôt work for me‚Ä¶‚Äù

I did all the math you can possibly do in your head in less than a second:

what does that mean?

that‚Äôs inappropriate‚Ä¶right?

what does that have to do with her being qualified or not?

is someone going to say something?

if I say something, do I have to worry about my job?

wait, would this leader ever say that directly to her?

should I warn this candidate to not take the job?

You know what I did. Nothing. I was silent.

And you know that because most of you have been in this situation and also done nothing. That is not judgement - it‚Äôs just recognition that we are collectively complicit.

Someone said something that didn‚Äôt even acknowledge the comment, and the meeting ended awkwardly.

I have intentionally not said anything about the race / ethnicity of the woman. I am also purposely not identifying the gender / race of the senior leader. Because either could be anyone. This type of micro-aggression is so common in the workplace that to call it out every time it happens would grind the day to a halt. Before I wrote this, I spent a minute thinking through all the times I‚Äôd see some sketchy comment / behavior, and I came up with a dozen easily, because they were so beyond borderline. It‚Äôs not exaggeration to say I could catalog

hundreds

of instances if I sat down and thought about my entire work history.

Over the years, I‚Äôve thought a lot about why I didn‚Äôt speak up. This week I‚Äôve gone over it constantly. Sometimes I tell myself I didn‚Äôt recognize the inappropriateness. Sometimes I tell myself I was so young and early in my career. Sometimes I tell myself others with bigger voices should have spoken up. Sometimes I tell myself that I had a million other worries in life at that point, keeping me up at night.

It‚Äôs been ~ 20 years. I will occasionally look up both people (the person who made the comment, and the person about whom the comment was made) on LinkedIn to see where their careers went. I wonder if me having said something, to either of them, would have mattered in any tangible way.

And after this week, I realized that, yes, it would have mattered. A lot. It would have mattered to me. Because I still have a million different worries in life, but the thing that keeps me up at night is not any of those things. It‚Äôs the silence that suffocates‚Ä¶

It's Time to Kill Your Product,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/its-time-to-kill-your-product,"One of the more interesting exercises a start-up (or scale-up) will do on occasion is to brainstorm how to ‚Äúkill the company‚Äù. It‚Äôs a little bit like a SWOT analysis that a more established company would hire a consulting firm to do, but done in-house by the folks who understand the product and market context intimately based on their day-to-day role (e.g. PM or CSM).

In my side endeavors as an advisor and mentor to B2B companies, I‚Äôve noticed more and more that the Head of (whatever department) that I‚Äôm speaking with is asking in a round-about way whether their current / proposed strategy results in a viable business in ~ 1 year. The 1st and 2nd order questions that go into ‚Äúam I building a real B2B SaaS product business?‚Äù are very much how I think about the ‚Äúkill the company‚Äù exercise, so I thought I‚Äôd share them today.

For each department, there‚Äôs a decision point that I think pressure (via customers, competitors, or investors) brings to the surface:

R&D (product + engineering + design): what is the state of the core workflow?

Marketing: do I have a structured way to get new prospects to my doorstep?

GTM (pre / post sales): how do I showcase ROI and get customer there ASAP?

Stepping back, if you can start to answer these questions, you can get a read on both your internal business and the broader customer base. From a business perspective, it‚Äôs about figuring out if you need to prove value while surviving, or recoup value while consolidating. And when looking at your customer base wholistically, you need to figure out who‚Äôs leaning into you as a vendor vs looking elsewhere.

The visual above shows both the 1st and 2nd order questions I‚Äôve been using to guide folks. The answers to these questions can inform not only your overall company strategy, but help determine the bets you want to make as a product and GTM team to create a business that sustains.

Layering AI into your B2B Product and GTM,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/layering-ai-into-your-b2b-product,"A while back, I had laid out a formula for a successful B2B business: it‚Äôs a series of loops (credit to this

Kevin Kwok essay

for the concept). The gist of the idea:

individual -> team productivity

consumer -> creator mixshift

enterprise -> ecosystem reach

Simply put, your initial product wedge is to boost individual user productivity to a degree that their broader cross-functional team sees the benefit. You then need to get a critical mass of users exhibiting that power user behavior, usually by improving their literacy or simplifying the workflow to the point where consumers become creators. And finally, you extend your reach into the broader ecosystem by introducing a platform play.

So you have a bunch of B2B SaaS products in the market today following this playbook to various degrees (sometimes knowingly, sometimes not). And now, with the recent advancements in generative AI, you‚Äôre being asked to layer AI into your B2B product and GTM more prominently‚Ä¶so what do you do?

The short answer is you revisit those company building loops and ask:

How can AI shorten the path to a major increase in user productivity?

How can AI accelerate shifting casual consumers into active creators?

How can AI expand the effects of my network across the ecosystem?

There is absolutely friction on each of these dimensions that previously was either a fixed cost that had to be paid (e.g. a complex setup process) or a heavy tax that was hard to get around (e.g. learning curve for new users) - the value of AI is to fundamentally revisit and rethink these costs and taxes - do they even need to be paid and could they be managed much more cheaply in terms of user / buyer time and effort?

Layering AI into your B2B Product and GTM (Video),https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/layering-ai-into-your-b2b-product-8e7,"Earlier this week I had raised questions for folks to ponder when weaving AI into their B2B products:

How can AI create a major increase in task productivity?

How can AI accelerate shifting novices to power users?

How can AI extend the reach of my network effects?

There is absolutely friction on each of these dimensions that previously was either a fixed cost that had to be paid (e.g. a complex setup process) or a heavy tax that was hard to get around (e.g. learning curve for new users) - the value of AI is to fundamentally revisit and rethink these costs and taxes - do they even need to be paid and could they be managed much more cheaply in terms of user / buyer time and effort?

The video above is a conversation with

Anurag Wadehra

on how to think about layering AI into your B2B product and motion. The visual below was key to framing the discussion:

The big takeaways from this framework are that the ‚Äújobs to be done‚Äù within an enterprise that a B2B product tries to map to fundamentally involve:

multiple players

feedback loops

varying ROI levels

And by incorporating AI into your product you can eliminate redundant tasks, automate repetitive work, provide real-time relevant assistance, and even reason about your business differently such that goals can be re-framed and de-risked.

and (2)

a startup CEO representing the acquiree

. We titled the session ‚ÄúDon't Get Arrested During Diligence and Other Startup M&A Advice‚Äù because (a) that was an anecdote that actually came up during the discussion and (b) we all share a a sense of humor around the quirkiness of corporate life. But all joking aside, M&A is a topic on which there is not much public literature, because the people involved are too busy innovating or operating, so it was really eye-opening to get a first-hand account of how a deal came together (

Box‚Äôs acquisition of Butter.ai

). The most interesting thing for me was this all happened in 2018, long before it was cool to put .ai in your company name‚Ä¶

We‚Äôll also be discussing this episode further in the Run the Business private Slack community, another benefit of the paid plan!

We started the conversation talking through how an acquiring company sets a strategic vision and shortlists a set of investment areas for which acquisition might make sense. We also touched on the criteria used to find the right team - one term that was used to describe the type of startup talent required to up-level a focus area at a larger company was a ‚Äúkick down the door mentality‚Äù. It was also interesting to learn how critical executive sponsors were to getting a deal done and how much effort goes into maintaining momentum within a larger organization.

From the perspective of the startup being acquired, the serendipity of how things come together was surprising; if you‚Äôre busy building a business and you get an inbound offer, it triggers a diligence process that you hadn‚Äôt accounted for at all and can be a distraction if it drags on too long. Given that the example we covered was ultimately a successful deal, the big takeaway was actually integrating startup into scaleup was ‚Äúthe best MBA you could ever imagine‚Äù.",2025-03-01,like-a-bullet-hitting-jell-o-2025-03-01
Make Mom Proud,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/make-mom-proud,"Sometimes, I create and popularize memes‚Ä¶in my own head. Let me explain.

My first day at Box, I went through orientation like any other new hire. At some point during the day, the company values (including Make Mom Proud) were unveiled. Make Mom Proud was explained as ‚Äúimagine your mom was here with you at the office - behave as if she‚Äôs watching over your shoulder - think about what she would say"".‚Äù

And that‚Äôs when it happened.

I imagined my mom was there with me at the office, watching over my shoulder - and I didn‚Äôt even need to think about what she would say. My mom basically says the same handful of catchphrases all the time. Her sayings have become key tenets of how I function as a professional.

‚Äúthe first impression is the last Impression‚Äù

Yes, my mom was ahead of the curve on unconscious biases. The pre-conceived notions people have about you affect everything from your professional network to your career prospects. And if you can get a quick win in a new role, you get a reputation for success that is hard to shake (in a good way).

‚Äúnothing personal, just business‚Äù

My mom loves to quote old Bollywood movies, which tend to pay homage to old Hollywood movies. So what can you learn from

The Godfather

? Trade-offs will come up at work, but if you keep the overall business in mind vs your own ambition, you‚Äôll make the right call.

‚Äúgo.to.bed.‚Äù

Ever sit in bed typing and re-typing an email response? It‚Äôs the end of a long day and you can‚Äôt string together the words to get your point across. Just go to sleep. Inbox Zero is way more achievable when you‚Äôre well rested and thinking clearly.

‚Äúwhen are you coming to visit?‚Äù

You have customers and partners outside your enterprise - it‚Äôs imperative that you nurture those relationships all the time. It‚Äôs just tacky to call and check in only when you really need a favor.

‚Äútake your brother with you!‚Äù

You will only get so far in individual hero mode. You need to lead a team to scale your output, and you need to align cross-functionally to achieve meaningful outcomes.

‚Äúhere‚Äôs $1, and a list of things to get from the store‚Ä¶‚Äù

Ambition always outweighs resources (people, money, time). Frugality breeds resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention. Yes, my mom foreshadowed an

Amazon leadership principle

It‚Äôs been a few years since my onboarding, but the mom meme is still strong (and serving me well).

Manufacturing Champions (Part 1),https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/manufacturing-champions-part-1,"‚ÄúGoals are for people who care about winning once.

Systems are for people who care about winning repeatedly.""

James Clear

This is going to be an evergreen series of essays that connects several concepts I‚Äôve shared before while also serving as a foundation for future posts. It‚Äôs my thesis on the shared, but latent, north star of any B2B product company. Below is Part 1, you can read

Part 2 here

.

In any company, when different departments and functions row in the same direction, you‚Äôre more likely to meet your goals and hit your milestones than if teams are misaligned. And in a B2B product company, it‚Äôs critical that your engineering, product, and design (EPD) teams, which build your product, and your go-to-market (GTM) organization, which distributes your product, are in lock step. I‚Äôm oversimplifying a bit here, because people in either organization can and should get involved with activities across the aisle (for example PMs closing deals or marketers conducting research), but at the C-level, you have separate, single-threaded owners for both delivery and deployment.

This alignment matters irrespective of the playbook your company uses to get your B2B product into the hands of your prospective and paying customers; meaning, whether you utilize a self-serve motion, partner channels, or a direct salesforce, cohesion across EPD and GTM is the key to getting the growth flywheel going. The only thing that changes across models is the ratio of EPD staff to GTM folks and how much is managed in-house vs through external stakeholders.

So, the partnership between EPD and GTM is critical, and ultimately the difference between being a linear-growth services business and a compound-growth product company (see references below to understand the difference). Given how crucial this interlock between organizations is, you‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôs a huge focus area for EPD and GTM leaders? And the best B2B product companies must have this on auto-pilot? Right?

Apparently not.

I‚Äôve been a product executive reporting to the CPO of public companies for the last 7 years and also a mentor and advisor to dozens of start-ups and scale-ups over that time - no one has this figured out. Whenever you get close to having a handle on it, something shifts and you‚Äôre back to square one.

What‚Äôs going on?

Well, as always, it helps to start by looking at the symptoms. What does it feel like when EPD and GTM are talking past each other?

sales feels like PM is not listening to them on new products to build for revenue

PMs feel like the demo team is over-indexed on ‚Äúwow‚Äù features that no one uses

marketing feels like there‚Äôs no differentiation to highlight in a crowded category

support feels like engineering is ignoring quality issues affecting customers

growth feels like free users are not on equal footing with paying customers

design is frustrated that customer success showed internal mockups externally

CSMs are pissed that PMs won‚Äôt prioritize fixing longstanding onboarding issues

the business development team feels like partner asks go into an EPD black hole

research wonders why GTM won‚Äôt introduce them to power users to learn from

everyone feels like pricing and packaging issues are the other organization‚Äôs fault

you can see a longer, crowd-sourced laundry list of issues in

this LinkedIn post

Sound familiar? Every GTM team feels that if it could just control the roadmap, revenue and retention are right around the corner. And all EPD organizations just know that if GTM stopped overreacting to every customer conversation, adoption and pipeline would materialize.

Are they both right? Is everyone wrong? And who the heck should own pricing and packaging?

A big part of the issue here is that these 2 organizations, which make up the bulk of people investment and operate much like a right arm and left arm for the company body, are running in different directions. They both have short-term and long-term objectives, but whichever mode they‚Äôre in, they need the other to drastically shorten or length their operating horizon. When PMs want to do market validation for a future product idea, it‚Äôs not a good time to distract sales from end of quarter chaos. When customer success needs a major feature delivered in-quarter to ensure an enterprise customer renews, the roadmap was locked by PMs months ago. When GTM proactively tells EPD they need to pull in a feature for demand generation, it turns out EPD doesn‚Äôt have enough engineers with

<super special skill>

and it‚Äôs going to take too long to hire. When EPD has the foresight to broadcast a product deprecation, GTM pushes back because there is a

<critical customer churn>

that they want to avoid.

These types of misalignments happen all day every day in a B2B product company. And even when they manage to get resolved through escalations and tradeoffs, rather than being able to celebrate the current win, employees fixate on the past thrash and future cost. It‚Äôs just more painful than it should be, but no one seems to have figured out a good solution other than tons of circular meetings, armies of operations people, and oodles of change management paperwork.

There has to be a better way. And there is.

There is a flaw in the logic of how EPD and GTM teams are set up in most companies. It‚Äôs even apparent in this essay until this point. There is an implicit assumption that EPD and GTM have different goals and operate on different time horizons, and that inherent tension is the source of eternal conflict and necessitates all manner of people, process, and tooling to maintain a balance. Because no EPD rockstar wants to work at a sales-led product company. And no GTM hotshot wants to work in an environment where commercialization is an afterthought thrown over the wall.

What if I told you that this framing was flawed? What if EPD and GTM actually shared the same goal and could operate in concert, both in the short- and long- term? What if there was a shared, but latent, north star that could align the right arm and the left arm?

There is. The shared objective across EPD and GTM that no one talks about is‚Ä¶Manufacturing Champions!

What do I mean by that? Let‚Äôs define both aspects of it:

Manufacturing = making something, usually on a large scale, via an automated process, with controls for quality, guarantees of volume, and monitored SLAs

Champions = advocates for a product, who may be direct users or indirect beneficiaries, who can tell stories about ROI, and serve as both evangelists to the broader market and enablers for future adopters

In short, Manufacturing Champions is the idea that you need a playbook for regularly and reliably creating advocates for your product who can drive current user adoption and generate future customer pipeline.

I don‚Äôt care if you work in EPD or GTM, that sounds like exactly what your product and company need to scale. In fact, if you could mash together EPD and GTM into some sort of hybrid role with shared goals, let‚Äôs say Growth, this is how they would approach the problem. Said another way, if you are regularly manufacturing champions, then you have a reliable growth loop.

Let‚Äôs delve into why this shared objective is so powerful for employees across EPD and GTM:

a champion speaking at your conference helps create qualified leads

a champion at a prospect helps shape your demo script for success

a champion in a deal helps navigate internal stakeholder objections

a champion in an account helps make the budget case for procurement

a champion in a company helps onboard new and novice users quickly

a champion on a team helps drive sophisticated adoption and usage

a champion is a power user who provides insightful product feedback

a champion takes the time to write feature requests and support tickets

a champion at a customer helps prepare for the exec business review

a champion on the ground helps smooth the way for renewal and upsell

Everyone loves a champion! They are instrumental for both EPD

and

GTM success. They are essential now

and

in the future.

So why isn‚Äôt every B2B product company spending the majority of its time trying to create a playbook for Manufacturing Champions? I share my thoughts on that in

Part 2

‚ÄúGoals are for people who care about winning once.

James Clear

This is going to be an evergreen series of essays that connects several concepts I‚Äôve shared before while also serving as a foundation for future posts. It‚Äôs my thesis on the shared, but latent, north star of any B2B product company. Check out

Part 1

.

In the prior post in this series, I laid out the case for Manufacturing Champions - the idea that you need a playbook for regularly and reliably creating advocates for your product who can drive current user adoption and generate future customer pipeline. Said another way, if you are manufacturing champions, then you have a growth loop.

In this essay I want to delve more into why this approach isn‚Äôt more prevalent across B2B product companies. Because intuitively the concept resonates - why wouldn‚Äôt EPD and GTM collaborate on turning users and buyers into evangelists? Why wouldn‚Äôt a product team accept the gift of a power user helping drive adoption? Why wouldn‚Äôt a sales team take advantage of a insider helping drive account expansion. Why wouldn‚Äôt a design team lean on an early adopter to provide feedback on concepts? Why wouldn‚Äôt a marketing team let an influencer serve as a reference to generate leads?

Champions are essential to the product lifecycle from an EPD perspective and instrumental to the distribution playbook from a GTM lens. But this idea of coordinated collaboration between the 2 orgs being the more important flywheel at a company is not the prevailing wisdom of the day. How come?

Because of a powerful but invisible force at work across companies: conceptual inertia.

What is conceptual inertia? It‚Äôs the tendency of a system (like say a B2B company) to reject any newfangled ideas until the pressure mounts to fundamentally rethink things (like say stalled growth).

It‚Äôs not simply that there is a lack of awareness about a concept - the inertia extends into considering it, discussing it, implementing it, learning it, and evangelizing it. Think about how long it takes for an ritual from a fast-growing company to get disseminated. Think about how difficult it is to get basic tooling deployed. Think about how the implementation of universally-accepted best practices is fought tooth and nail in organizations that are struggling to scale.

To test out this idea, I polled folks on LinkedIn to see what operating models that everyone knows should be used sit in the learning rituals backlog and on the change management shelf. Some of the stuff that came up included the following:

everyone wants to use data to make decisions‚Ä¶but they struggle to do it

everyone knows talking to customers is high ROI‚Ä¶but they still skip that step

everyone feels the qualtity cost of rushed releases‚Ä¶but they happen all the time

everyone has been burned by building one-off features‚Ä¶but it keeps happening

everyone knows you need tailor messaging across channels‚Ä¶but we still duplicate

you can see a longer, crowd-sourced laundry list of issues in

this LinkedIn post

And this is just the stuff everyone knows better about. What about the emerging frameworks and nascent principles that haven‚Äôt even been blogged about or mentioned on a podcast? We‚Äôre so adept at ignoring documented knowledge, we have yet to make it to the learnings that are trapped in the brains of folks pushing the boundaries of EPD and GTM teams.

So is it all doom and gloom? No - and I‚Äôll tell you why. There are 3 things to keep in mind if you‚Äôre intrigued by the possibility of rejiggering your EPD and GTM orgs around the manufacturing champions concept:

1. There are success stories you can point to that appear with different terminology, and that is critical in getting ‚Äúthe powers that be‚Äù to consider enacting a change

2. A lot of best practices that aren‚Äôt widely adopted or stuck in transition purgatory end up that way because the host environment rejects the transplanted process

3. The essence of manufacturing, which entails automating the production of something with quality controls and volume guarantees, is a unique assembly line

Let me elaborate on each of these points.

On [1], you may have never heard it referred to as manufacturing champions, but this concept has been around to power growth and scale for many companies. Many PLG companies with a self-serve motion have 1 Growth leader straddling marketing and product, because they understand the lifecycle of customer acquisition, activation, monetization, and retention needs to be tight-knit. But the idea of a Growth leader spanning EPD and GTM is not limited to a PLG context - it‚Äôs just not that common outside it. Many Enterprise companies have a GM that owns both R&D and the book of business, because they understand the need to unify development and commercialization under 1 executive. But the need for a directly responsible individual like a GM isn‚Äôt isolated to Enterprise companies - it‚Äôs just not caught on beyond that segment. The point I‚Äôm making is people have organized around the north star of manufacturing champions before, but it‚Äôs not clicked for everyone that this model might actually make sense for them too.

On [2], I have great news. Let‚Äôs start with why many transformation efforts die - because the system wants to stay in stasis and rejects the intervention. For example, your org never look at metrics, new leader comes in and wants to see weekly metrics, 18 months of arguing about the state of your data pipeline later, you have a dashboard no one uses with some vanity metrics. There are similar stories for user research, release management, demand generation, etc. So why would something as foundational as manufacturing champions catch on? Because if you‚Äôve managed to create any kind of viable company, product, and motion, then you‚Äôre already doing it. You‚Äôre just doing it with a lot of friction and fumbling. Think of it as operationalizing what you‚Äôre already doing as a business to acquire and retain customers, without any of the cruft, the distractions, the roadblocks, etc. When you try and roll out a new operating model oriented around manufacturing champions, you‚Äôll find you‚Äôre speaking to a captive audience of employees who already have the cogs lined up to get the machine humming. In short, some assembly required, but you‚Äôre not going against the grain.

On [3], when you set out to manufacture champions, you‚Äôll discover that the ingredients and recipe are unique to your company and approach. You won‚Äôt be able to copy/paste someone else‚Äôs approach to manufacturing, because you don‚Äôt source your parts from the same places, you don‚Äôt assemble things in the same way, and your customers don‚Äôt come to you because they want the same widget. If you‚Äôre truly being asked by your prospective customer base to literally build something that looks and feels like a competitor‚Äôs product, just slightly more polished or at a reduce price point, then shut down assembly; you are in a commoditized category and in a shrinking market. But if you‚Äôve truly tapped into growing demand with a differentiated offering, then streamlining getting product into the hands of a primed audience and leveraging those reference-able logos to create the next wave of demand is the best thing you can do for your company. And because you won‚Äôt want, need, or be able to replicate your competition, you‚Äôll come up with your own distinctive flavor of EPD and GTM organization and collaboration.

So, to recap, manufacturing champions is a highly attractive and potentially lucrative idea that hasn‚Äôt (yet) gone mainstream due to conceptual inertia - but there is hope on the horizon because ultimately this operating model leans into enhancing what is working for a company and will resonate with the employee base that is the true execution engine of the org.

In the next post in this series, I‚Äôm going to spend some time exploring the realities of how most EPD and GTM orgs are structured and incentivized and how a motivated leader might steer their company towards a more collaborative model. Until then, you can re-read

Manufacturing Currency,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/manufacturing-currency,"It‚Äôs fascinating where product lessons come from, especially when you‚Äôre not in a mode where you‚Äôre expecting it. I was recently listening to a pitch session where various founder were walking through their early-stage start-up ideas, and I got the most interesting tutorial on creating value (where at first glance there isn‚Äôt any).

This particular founder had built a gifting app - a deal of the day type service, but with an added twist of personalization. So rather than everyone getting access to buy 1 (or a pre-set # of) discounted item(s), the hook was the item would be guaranteed to delight the person receiving the gift (assuming you had answered the detailed questionnaire correctly). The app had apparently been gaining some traction, and users were raving about the quality of gift recommendations - nothing builds word of mouth better than relieved husbands getting the right gifts for their wives.

Where the conversation got really interesting for me was the business model. Basically, the company was doing a tight dance on pre-buying enough quantity in bulk for the margins to make sense, but not so much that they had excess inventory lying around. In their business, ‚Äúsold out‚Äù was not necessarily a bad thing, but if the average user‚Äôs experience always ended in ‚Äúsold out‚Äù, then it would become a problem. Arbitraging on merchandise is not a scalable business model unless (a) you‚Äôve got a monopoly on some hot item or (b) you‚Äôre Amazon and scaling hyper-efficiently.

So‚Ä¶how else could this gifting app make money?

Well, after building a user base that has faith that the gifts will be spot-in terms of delight-factor AND creating belief that items will quickly ‚Äúsell out‚Äù, the founder realized his service had unintentionally manufactured a currency that people valued:

time

!

People were falling over themselves to log into the app at exactly the moment the new gifts dropped, and even a precious few seconds mattered between the have‚Äôs and have-not‚Äôs. And extra time was something users were willing to pay for. So the concept of buying

early access

was introduced, and a rewards program was created where regular buyers were gifted

chunks of seconds

for their loyalty. Coming soon: the ability to trade and transfer time to other users on the platform.

I found the whole setup to be a fascinating spin on value creation and communication‚Ä¶

In my nearly 4 years at Amplitude, one of the most common customer deployment questions was around what flows are worth measuring. And while many product teams get wrapped around the axle on instrumentation questions, to me there‚Äôs a very simple method to figure out what your critical path is: pretend your product is having the worst outage in the history of your company and you have to bring the core service back online piecemeal until things stabilize - what are the P0 capabilities you have your incident response team working to revive?

It‚Äôs funny how a disaster can bring clarity to what really matters. This exercise usually results in a shortlist of features and components that are ‚Äúbusiness critical‚Äù. Stitch them together and you have your core workflow.

Getting good at this exercise, both the initial baseline and subsequent iterations, is a key part of product observability; this in turn is the foundation for driving growth, running experiments, scaling load, managing costs, and tackling adjacencies. Which is why I went and got

Jon Harmer

from Google to talk about their methodology for mapping and measuring critical user journeys (aka CUJs). There‚Äôs a whole

Reforge deep-dive

into how Google‚Äôs product teams utilize CUJs.

We started our conversation with a definition of CUJs, which Jon ties to (a) user jobs to be done and (b) the revenue generating customer flow - I think those are great signals to look for when trying to pinpoint your CUJ. If you‚Äôve never bothered to spell out jobs to be done for your target user and are unclear how your product makes money, you have a different problem - you have user journeys but none are critical ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø.

We then touched on the different ways to actually get a baseline map of your CUJ, which include both quantitative and qualitative techniques. In fact, applying both methods likely results in a deeper understanding of your key flows. (This is something I‚Äôve

written about before

).

Once you‚Äôve got your CUJ mapped out, it serves as a baseline for both your operating objectives (e.g. service uptime, workflow throughput) and innovation goals (e.g. user adoption, market capture). Without this benchmark, you don‚Äôt know what good looks like or how high your ceiling might be, and your product work is just random bets lacking surgical sophistication.

The process of connecting (or attempting to connect) product work to company strategy through KPI trees is how you figure out whether you are working towards a launch (output) or a land (outcome). I‚Äôve

written

and spoken (

here

,

here

,

here

) about connecting product bets to business outcomes before. The fascinating insight Jon shares here is that the majority of product features either add no value or detract from the core job to be done.

Over the course of our hour together, we hit on a bunch of other dimensions of user journey mapping and measurement, including:

the need to end-of-life features that don‚Äôt apply to or enhance the CUJ

the downside of precision when a simple thumbs up / down will suffice

There are numerous constraints, pressures, and incentives surrounding product teams, and they can conspire to drive this well-intentioned but dysfunctional behavior. Let me count the ways‚Ä¶

Many teams are on a journey to be more rigorous, but they sometimes view being data-* (data-informed, data-driven, data-influenced) as the end goal. The introduction of a metric is viewed as the first and last step on that journey, the completion of a transformation from not being data-* to being data-*. The reality is it takes time to re-set a charter around a metric, and reps to re-align the team‚Äôs operating model.

Other teams allow outside factors to determine their metrics as opposed to their unique (and more comprehensive) understanding of their (actual and prospective) users. The ‚Äúoutside factors‚Äù could range from internal leadership who are not privy to the team‚Äôs domain knowledge to external competition that influences thinking. If you think of a product team as a learning entity, not leveraging that learning for metrics construction is silly.

One latent but recurring issue is also the complexity of data management in any organization of meaningful size. The accuracy / quality / completeness / cost of data required to track a metric can be serious considerations. Some teams just don‚Äôt have the ability to actually instrument what they‚Äôd like to, so they settle for proxies or what‚Äôs possible.

Finally, there is significant change management overhead whenever you introduce / update a metric. There are many organizational hurdles for a metrics champion to overcome, including inertia, stubbornness, and disbelief. Sometimes you‚Äôre just forced to pick something because of process deadlines (e.g. annual planning or quarterly review). It‚Äôs only natural to over-index on metrics that might be easy to understand (legibility) and rally around (synchronicity).

To recap, I see 7 root causes of metrics malfunction:

lack of rigor

time pressure

desire for simplicity

copying competition

change management

top-down directives

instrument-ability

Again, falling into one of these traps doesn‚Äôt mean a team is malfunctioning - they‚Äôre just not done iterating.

I‚Äôd love to hear from readers about their own experiences with avoiding / succumbing to metrics malfunction - please chime in via commentsüëá. And if you enjoyed this post, please consider

Much TODO About Nothing,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/much-todo-about-nothing,"For the longest time, during the pre-smartphone days, before there were all manner of task-tracking and note-taking apps, I carried around an 8.5"" x 11"" sheet of paper in my pocket along with a little pencil (stolen, err borrowed, from my local library). The paper was folded in half 3 times so it was about the size of a billfold, and on it was written my near-term TODO list. And without fail I completed almost everything I had on my list every day. And every night I would write out the next days TODOs on a clean panel of the sheet of paper (using about 1 sheet per week), and repeat this cycle, with 90-100% completion, daily. The system worked gloriously for nearly a decade.

And then I switched to a smartphone. And TODO lists become longer. And slightly more abstract. And way more ambitious. The formatting was off the charts, but I felt I was getting less and less done every day. This went on for about 5 years, with my TODO list being a braindump and me using a variety of other tools (GMail, Outlook, JIRA, stickies) to actually manage short- and long- term tasks. Because my TODO list had become a catch-all blob, it was hard for me to focus on the top

n

things that really mattered each day. Moreover, it was (too) easy to tack items on and I was getting less and less done daily; and the feeling of getting less done every day compounded my waning confidence in getting things done, period.

So I switched up¬†the structure¬†a little bit. About 7 years ago I started bucketing my TODO list into 4 areas:

I‚Äôve gotten really good at making ""everyday"" TODOs a habit now, which is why I don't need to put that at the top. I keep ""today"" short and prioritized so that I can actually accomplish things. And ""tomorrow"" is an exercise in pushing from ""today"" and pulling from ""some day"". Periodically, I sift through ""some day"" and just drop altogether. This approach has been working pretty well, both personally and professionally.

But lately, in my more Luddite-like moments, I wish I could set aside the smartphone. As much TODO prowess as it gives me for my GSD lifestyle, it also comes with all sorts of notifications and reminders and interruptions and distractions. Strangely, or predictably, I miss the sheet of paper and the little pencil.

And I can't shake the feeling that I got more done back then. And was more efficient too. I've been mulling over why that might be the case, and I've arrived at a counter-intuition conclusion: the smartphone has nearly eliminated any friction in my task management routine, but it was precisely that friction that forced me to prioritize and focus. Having to rewrite a TODO list from scratch every day meant a few things, implicitly:

it felt weird to rewrite the same task daily, so I would either finish it or convince myself (usually correctly) that it wasn't a priority - my smartphone TODO list easily becomes a stale pile of task laundry

I was limited to 1/8 panels of the folder letter-size sheet of paper - the TODO list had to be finite, even with my chicken-scratch handwriting - my smartphone TODO list goes on for many page scrolls

in order to add something, I would have to drop something, or write sideways (which drove me nuts) - my smartphone TODO list is a little too accommodating when it comes to piling on

I could only add to the bottom - my smartphone TODO list allows me to introduce new items for ""today"" and interrupt any flow I'd conceived the night before

Now, I know what you're thinking. Can't I just aggressively prune my smartphone TODO list daily and achieve the same results? Maybe, with discipline, but more often than not, I know I don't have to; it's already pre-populated for every day with the things I haven't gotten done, whereas before I was starting with a blank panel on a sheet of paper unless I explicitly put something on there. And that is the biggest psychological difference now in my view; starting fresh daily is a different mindset than picking up where you left off yesterday.

So I'm seriously considering going Luddite and returning to physical vs. digital. Hopefully the local library still has those little pencils.

Would love to hear from readers about their TODO list hacks‚Ä¶

New Knowledge is in the Doing,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/new-knowledge-is-in-the-doing,"Everyone knows the feeling of Imposter Syndrome, but sometimes as a leader you also deal with just being an Imposter; your team will ask you for guidance on something that you have never actually done yourself. Obviously as the number of degrees between an org leader and individual contributors grows, the less likely the leader has a handle on the day-to-day work, but many execs (including me), rely on their past experience to bridge that gap and provide useful direction; but there are instances where you either have no experience to call on or it‚Äôs so legacy that the context no longer applies. For example, whenever a new hiring manager asks me about talent management (sourcing, selling, closing, onboarding, coaching) I feel like I can share timeless insights‚Ä¶but if a PM asks me the best way to organize a backlog that cuts across 7 different tools to collect customer input, it dawns on me that I haven‚Äôt even used 6 of them. What is a product leader to do?

While texting with a friend (who is building a company and doing 0 ‚Üí 1 product work) I lamented this situation where you end up either providing non-relevant advice to folks or just end up in ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶but let me see if I can connect you with someone who might be able to help‚Äù. We somehow started talking about ending up in a danger zone where you‚Äôre basically a consultant pitching frameworks without any context on the company / product / team‚Ä¶and he had an amazing insight; you have to, from time to time, get back to doing work (vs just directing work) to keep your perspectives fresh. He said: ‚Äúnew knowledge is in the doing‚Äù. It was why he had actually gone back to his startup roots and was enjoying building a new product from scratch. His point was that just because you‚Äôre in a leadership role doesn‚Äôt mean you can never go back and climb that ladder again with a new set of learnings.

‚ÄúNew Knowledge‚Ä¶is in the Doing‚Äù

So what does this mean for product leaders who might be feeling out of touch? A few thoughts that I‚Äôm still mulling over myself:

new product discovery

opportunities to jam

synthesized learning rituals

[1] New Product Discovery

Even if you‚Äôre managing a mature product with a lot of ‚Äúrun the business‚Äù type R&D effort (customer love, tech debt, etc) you will have opportunities to explore new products that complement your core offering OR you can explore the edges of your product through adjacencies, partners, etc. Since product-market fit is fleeting, you‚Äôll always have to once again find fit as it drifts - this type of product discovery work is a chance to flex in this direction without encroaching on the charter of your existing teams.

[2] Opportunities to Jam

Every company has (or should have) time allotted to do pure ideation work - a forum where you can check your existing constraints at the door and think through new solution paths to existing problems. This could look like a design sprint, and engineering hackathon, etc - I‚Äôve fallen into the trap before of using these time periods to actually deal with the backlog of management tasks, but it‚Äôs a great (and under-utilized) mechanism for product leaders to revisit their IC prime.

[3] Synthesized Learning Rituals

Your org should be synthesizing and sharing learnings on a regular basis - this can look like like a product release retro, a customer advisory board, a user research call, etc. Too often leaders think their job is to just ensure the ritual is happening vs actually carving out time to not only consume the output but actually offer feedback to change outcomes. As in, don‚Äôt just complain that there are too many meetings to join a user research call, ask your team to put together a ‚Äúbest of ‚Äú compilation, make time to listen to it, and share your takeaways with the team to start a dialogue vs just skimming their summary and feeling out of touch.

Notably Not,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/notably-not,"Every PM deals with the problem of too many customer requests to accommodate, and the moment when you have to share your roadmap and inevitably disappoint someone in your user base is always tough. I find a now / next / later view of the roadmap (vs a date-based format) helps orient customers on if / when you might get to their ask. But there tends to be a lot of stuff in the later bucket‚Ä¶

In a recent discussion with a PM in my network, I learned that Asana actually does something interesting / unique when presenting their roadmaps to customers: they have a section titled ‚ÄúNotably Not‚Äù. It‚Äôs basically a way to get ahead of customers asking ‚Äúwhat about‚Ä¶‚Äù. I loved this anecdote because I think it accomplishes as much as you can from a customer love perspective without actually shipping the feature.

Recognition

-  it acknowledges the customer and makes them feel heard - I‚Äôve worked with so many customers over the years who are just frustrated because they think their feature request when into the void due to lack of follow up

Absorption

- it highlights that you actually spent brain cycles / scoping energy considering it and are now in a position to have an informed discussion about it

Prioritization

- it surfaces the internal strategy / prioritization scheme by which the feature fell below the line and gives the customer an ‚Äúin‚Äù to debate

Any time you can elevate the customer from external, commercial stakeholder to internal, collaboration partner I think you‚Äôre modeling the essence of customer obsession, so this is a practice that I‚Äôm definitely going to adopt.

OKR Myths,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/okr-myths,"We‚Äôre going to be entering our quarterly planning cycle at Box soon, which always brings up the topic of output vs. outcomes (note: the angst around goal-setting frameworks is not unique to Box by any means). One of the better books I‚Äôve read on the topic is

Radical Focus

, which is basically a parable about implementing

OKRs

at a startup.

Ahem, yes, you read that correctly.

I studied a book on OKRs.

Let me start by saying I'm not generally what you'd characterize as a ""process person""; I tend to focus on getting things done and worry about improving the mechanics after, time permitting and team willing. But, I read (a lot) and always give a recommendation a chance (Radical Focus was cited by a former teammate who was ex-Zynga).

If there were ever a ""page turner"" of business planning books, this is it. It's in the same vein as

Patrick Lencioni's management tales

. I got a good bit out of it, specifically in terms of addressing myths around planning, and it's probably a book I'll return to every so often, much like

Rework

or

Linchpin

.

Also, the template / quadrant for tracking a product / initiative is very crisp and concise in my view, and something I leverage professionally (and sometimes personally)

At a high-level, the nuggets of wisdom I gleamed from the book can be summed up as a series of myths and corresponding solutions.

Myth #1: planning is a distraction from ""real work""

potentially - when planning is done just for the sake of planning, yes, but, if you step back and look at it as a planning -> execution -> learning loop, you'll recognize the need for a shared method across your org to align and scale

operationalizing how you work and how you work across organizational boundaries can be your secret sauce and allow you to do more ""real work""

Myth #2: quarterly planning is the wrong cadence

occasionally - there is ideal cadence for your group, it could be weekly or monthly or quarterly - it's something to test out and iterate on

the frequency is less importance than the regular rhythm - that's what completes the loop from just occasional / forced planning to improving execution through regular learning

Myth #3: OKRs don't make sense for my team

possibly - your team might be a functional reporting structure, in which case you‚Äôre thinking about the wrong ""team"" - focus on the products / initiatives

every individual spends their time across

n

groups trying to solve various customer / business problems - OKRs should be written across those horizontal / virtual teams and not around organizational hierarchy

Myth #4: our metric is status quo

definitely - maintaining SLAs around certain core product / business / operational makes absolute sense and should be table stakes

but KRs tied to ambitious objectives are different from health metrics that you don't want to adversely impact while going after systemic issues

Myth #5: our roadmap is our OKRs

correspondingly - the backlog of items you're shipping to move the KR needles tied to your objective are part of the package, but they serve a distinct purpose in terms of priorities, staffing, and momentum

and as you can see from the template, it's not onerous to track the roadmap, OKRs, and metrics in one clean snapshot

Myth #6: it's strange to be judged on progress of big bets

definitely - it's stranger still to be view a learning loop as a judgement tool; best to focus on the opportunity to get better at every check-in - better at prioritizing, better at hypothesizing, better at estimating, etc

adding in confidence % in addition to progress % and talking regularly about whether that's increasing or decreasing (and why) helps unblock and align

Myth #7: I'm hitting many OKRs with my roadmap

exactly - you should map your backlog to different objectives and some roadmap items could conceivably move the needle on multiple fronts (and thus should be prioritized higher)

the quadrant above isn't a template for all the work the team is doing; it's a snapshot per objective, so you should have multiple instances as needed across teams / products / initiatives / groups / councils / guilds / individuals

Would love to hear from readers (use the comments below) on their attempts at implementing OKRs, other goal-setting frameworks, etc

And in my efforts to learn Miro, I decided to make a quick visual out of it:

A dozen of these I find critical when you‚Äôre ramping up on a SaaS product, so let‚Äôs dig into those

customer journey map

- the repeatable playbook for how an account lands / expands and the GTM + product milestones on that path

customer maturity model

- a bucketing of the account base along clear lines of ‚Äúreadiness‚Äù for different parts of the product portfolio

product portfolio overview

- breakdown of the core product, key add-ons, and complementary modules along with canonical use cases for each

use case matrix

- all the recurring usage patterns for the product, potentially broken down by industry / department verticals

key differentiators

- structural, foundational product investments that cannot be easily copied by the competition in a reasonable timeframe

customer health model

- usually a RED / YELLOW / GREEN categorization based on certain usage levers / adoption milestones

north star primer

- what key metric the product org is focused on, how it‚Äôs calculated, what the drivers are, and how it ladders up to customer value

user adoption lifecycle

- what are the key aha! moments for things to click

lost report

- what are the recurring reasons we lose deals that came in as qualified leads?

professional services playbook

- what steps do implementation consultants take to get a customer onboarded onto product (usually 30/60/90 view)

personas in play

- who are the key players in the purchase, implementation, adoption, expansion, and renewal cycles (users / consumers / influencers)

company loop / product flywheel

- a synthesis of the core motion (across product development and go-to-market) that powers customer value / runs the business

Readers (and listeners) by now have recognized my interest in exploring

B2B

product building, especially the milestone of introducing a ‚Äúnext act‚Äù (I have a whole

Maven course

about this). In fact, I write and share about this topic so much that my former colleagues have started introducing me to experts that I can learn from. Not long ago, I was connected with

Inessa Lurye

, a product leader and healthcare innovator who most recently led new program development for subscription software and connected hardware products at

Hinge Health

.

In our brainstorming session before we recorded this episode, it became obvious that Inessa had tackled the problem of overcoming innovation inertia from several angles that would make for a rich discussion: regulated industries, stakeholder bias, GM model, gatekeeper navigation, etc.

The first and most foundational aspect of new product introduction (NPI) is aligning with company leadership on what outcome the product is intended to drive for the business.

But whatever outcome you align on with leadership, there‚Äôs a time horizon component that‚Äôs important to spell out as well. This insight was prompted by a great question from the audience - namely what are you supposed to do when execs say they want multiple different outcomes to play out with a single investment?

And expanding on what you (as a product leader) are supposed to do, part of the NPI playbook that Inessa and I strongly agreed on was the need for the PM to operate like a GM and drive the initial set of deals. This can be new and uncomfortable for a lot of product leaders working on 0-to-1 offerings for the first time, but in this clip Inessa spells out the multiple benefits of getting into the sales cycle firsthand.

And that exposure starts long before the product is built by asking a fundamental question about the target audience and expected buying behavior. I purposely highlighted this snippet because I‚Äôve seen many a product and/or and sales executive try to answer this question when trying to launch the new product; it‚Äôs too late at that juncture and this is something PM and GTM need need to collaborate on before the investment is even greenlit.

The conversation then dovetailed into the possibility of new products cannibalizing revenue from the existing portfolio. PMs can be lulled into a fantasy that the revenue attributed to their product line is all the same, but sometimes it‚Äôs shifting budgets as opposed to new spend; there is a difference between slicing the pie in new ways vs selling a new flavor altogether. In this clip, Inessa explains the different types of cannibalization and how to plan for that (it‚Äôs more art than science).

If there‚Äôs one takeaway from the discussion that I hope 0-to-1 product builders internalize and incorporate, it‚Äôs patience. More and more, companies and execs laud themselves for moving fast and reacting to incomplete signals, but to me operating on a long-term time horizon is the epitome of discipline. And discipline around strategy pays off better than constantly going back to the drawing board.

Over the course of our hour together, we hit on several other aspects of building 0-to-1 products in established companies, including:

Patience vs Progress,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/patience-vs-progress,"As someone who loves long-term planning and pay-off, I find myself sometimes getting caught up in the delicious intricacies of a plan. And while I (and others) may admire how ‚Äúplans are nothing, planning is everything‚Äù, to folks who can‚Äôt see the plan, that appreciation is lost. What I‚Äôve come to realize is that a very patient person doing 1% better every day can look like they‚Äôre not moving at all to an outside observer. In most organizations, progress (vs patience) is what is rewarded. And as an operator, it‚Äôs very important to recognize where your environment falls in the 2x2 of Patience vs Progress.

[-] Patience / [-] Progress

In an org where patience is low and progress is slow, it‚Äôs gut check time. What are we doing?

[-] Patience / [+] Progress

In an org where patience is low but progress is fast, it‚Äôs sanity check time. Are we doing the right things?

Pitch Your PoV,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/pitch-your-pov,"Last year, I had the opportunity to sit in on a GTM all hands at Box where one of our sales leaders relayed a great story about how to frame your product value around its core proposition (vs all the other other ways products get positioned). This talk really  shifted my mindset on how to even articulate product value, and as I

shared a few days ago

, story-telling is a critical tool in the PM‚Äôs bag of tricks. So let me walk you through the example‚Ä¶

In the late 70s / early 80s, Atari made a home video game console. The competition for this product was not another gaming system or some other form of home entertainment - it was the arcade. And if you were trying to sell an Atari and got caught in a comparison of features, you would lose, because arcade games:

had better audio and visual effects

used a familiar joystick controller

had communal high score leaderboards

and were just normal kid behavior

You could try to promise a future generation Atari console with some of those improvements, but that‚Äôs selling what might be on the truck next quarter vs. what‚Äôs on the truck right now. So how do you compete? Let‚Äôs re-frame the core proposition - the Atari:

let‚Äôs you play in the convenience of your home

avoids you being hassled by bullies at the arcade

takes a 1-time investment vs. never-ending coins

allows you to build out a cartridge game library

Now you‚Äôve made it very compelling for a particular types of buyer for whom that perspective resonates. And if you have a unique point of view (PoV), that should be your pitch, because that‚Äôs your true differentiator.

How can we apply this in our day-to-day?

if you‚Äôre in product, highlight your unique approach to the user‚Äôs problem

if you‚Äôre in design, visualize your unmistakable take on the persona journey

if you‚Äôre in engineering, build your transformative version of the technology

if you‚Äôre in marketing, articulate your distinct evaluation of market trends

if you‚Äôre in sales, sell your custom exploration of the buyer‚Äôs pain points

if you‚Äôre in success, communicate your tailored gameplan for business outcomes

if you‚Äôre in recruiting, share your undeniable analysis of the candidate‚Äôs career

I think startups focus too much on pitching features of their product where they could be selling their point of view on the market. Your point of view describes why you prioritized features the way you did and why your product is the best solution for a certain type of buyer 1/

PLG as You Move Up/Down Market,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/plg-as-you-move-updown-market,"‚ÄãPLG is almost universally applied (or desired) by every B2B product company. And while there are a lot of PLG success stories written up, the nuances of actually implementing and operationalizing such a motion are best learned through deep conversations with folks who have lived the journey. Which is why I‚Äôm really excited to share my recent conversation with

,

who leads the Growth Pillar at Asana

(and also writes the Reflections of a PM newsletter).

We covered quite a bit of ground in this session, including:

the differences between moving upmarket vs downmarket utilizing PLG

the need to think of PLG as a mindset shift requiring change management

the market dynamics that make a PLG motion appealing‚Ä¶and necessary

the importance of understanding your end user and buyer before PLG-ing

I found the discussion around user expectations of B2B software changing very telling - end users now expect to try out features beyond a basic demo, which is part of the broader

consumerization of enterprise software

. It‚Äôs a less cited but equally important part of the PLG push we‚Äôve seen in the industry (most of the focus seems to be on the efficiency of product-led vs sales-led revenue). Building on that, Shahzad highlights how being product-led is a counter-balance to the

feature factory mindset

.

Shahzad also had great insights into why most PLG efforts start with acquisition or monetization rather than other aspects of the user / buyer journey; it fundamentally comes down to your depth of understanding of your motion, and where the low-hanging fruit is for PLG to have an impact. Given the culture and mindset shift required to execute PLG properly across product and GTM teams, having these types of prioritization and trade-off discussions is critical.

As readers of this newsletter know, I love delving into data and metrics - that is definitely a major dimension of change with PLG. In the clip below, we discuss how things shift with metrics forecasting, tracking, and reporting. The big takeaway is the breadth evolves and you have to rethink your operations and rituals.

Our conversation also veered into a discussion of ‚Äúchampions‚Äù, which are critical to not only landing but expanding in B2B. One benefit of PLG is it allows you to be much more surgical in identifying and serving champions - in the clip below we learn about the ‚Äúchampion experience‚Äù team at Asana and how it operates.",2025-03-01,plg-as-you-move-updown-market-2025-03-01

PMs: Purists && Tweeners,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/pms-purists-and-and-tweeners,"Recently, we ran a retrospective on the evolution of the product org at Box, focusing on how PMs were doing in terms of opportunity, impact, growth, etc. Inevitably, as these discussions tend to, the conversation pivoted to the actual expectations of a PM, and the inherent variability in the role across managers / teams / companies. One telling quote from the discussion:

‚ÄúIf you polled 99 companies in the Bay Area you would get 99 definitions of what a PM is‚Ä¶‚Äù

There is some truth in that - PMs have been described as everything under the sun, ranging from ‚Äúglue‚Äù to ‚Äúbring the donuts‚Äù to ‚Äúhigh-leverage‚Äù to ‚ÄúCEO of the product‚Äù. All of that I‚Äôm sure has been true for some PM on some team at some company for some product at some point in time. And I‚Äôve seen that play out in my previous career stops (Twitter, Amazon). But if you‚Äôre a PM trying to navigate your ambiguously-defined, rapidly-evolving, forever-fluid role, you want to hear more than ‚Äúit varies‚Ä¶deal with it‚Äù.

I have thoughts‚Ä¶there are basically only 2 paths.

Purists

(aka feature facilitators)

Tweeners

(aka cross-functional leads)

Before I go further, let me establish a few things that I‚Äôve come to realize.

these are operating modes vs. fundamental traits

PMs will generally have a leaning, but can be both

you could have both profiles in the same group

a product area needs both over it‚Äôs lifecycle

one is not inherently better than the other

Let‚Äôs dig into what each of these looks like in practice.

Purists (aka feature facilitators)

These tend to be folks who either joined an APM program straight out of school (likely at a large company with well-established product lines) or folks who went to business school (and used it to make a career transition). They likely work on iterative products, with a clear set of metrics to drive to, with every release moving the needle incrementally. Their focus is execution and delivery, and writing OKRs is very straightforward. When this role goes sideways, the story is usually something along the lines of

‚Äúlot of output but no impact‚Äù

. Note: I labeled this group Purists because they tend to index on their credentials (academic and corporate).

Tweeners (aka cross-functional leads)

These are individuals who arrived at PM-ing through a circuitous route, likely stumbling into in when they started doing the role because there was a vacuum. They play a strong role in messier products, especially innovations, because of their ability to connect dots across disciplines. They are comfortable figuring out product-market fit, but struggle with writing crisp OKRs. When this role goes south, the knock is

‚Äústrong team culture but no output‚Äù

. Note: I tagged this bucket Tweeners because they tend to orient on their jack-of-all-trade-ness (multi-discipline backgrounds).

Let me provide some examples from my own experiences to add context.

At Amazon, I worked on the Kindle, and specifically started out tackling the device and accessories sales experience. Let me highlight 2 very different manifestations of my role based on the strategy

and

my interpretation of it.

A: ‚Äúoptimize the online order pipeline, specifically search result click-through, detail page visits to cart adds, successful checkouts, with reduced abandons‚Äù

B: ‚Äúmake the Kindle the preferred, premium reading experience‚Ä¶that‚Äôs all‚Äù

When my mindset was A, I was laser-focused on feature facilitation. We used customer feedback heavily to tackle issues like international buyers purchasing the wrong device, must-have accessories not being surfaced for add-on, and returns of prior-generation devices purchased right before a next-generation device announcement.

When I began to think in terms of B, we ended up building ads-subsidized devices, expanding to physical retail channels, and tapping into enterprise markets. And I operated more as a cross-functional lead who connected dots across a portfolio of investments.

What was more important for Amazon?

When did I learn more as a PM?

What created more customer value?

Hard to know, because we‚Äôre comparing

A

pples and‚Ä¶

B

agels.

When I think back to that time, I‚Äôm mostly thankful that the executive leadership team was thoughtful enough to evolve my role over the years based on my skillset and interest, combined with the needs of the business and the makeup of the broader org.

Counter that experience with the situation at Twitter, where (for a period) we had a bunch of PM angst on how to partner with Engineering and Design, because the EPD triad model was deadlocking decision making. I specifically remember a Q&A session with Jack Dorsey, where someone asked him how things worked at Square. His response (paraphrasing):

‚ÄúWe have teams that own problems. We don‚Äôt prescribe solutions. And depending on whether the effort is a design revamp or tech change or product feature, the respective functional representative serves as the lead.‚Äù

There were blank stares. Jack was trying to explain a cross-functional lead model to PMs that were elbow deep in feature facilitation. The Purist can‚Äôt comprehend the Tweener (and vice versa). There are rare folks who can function in both models, but it‚Äôs hard to have that meta-awareness when you‚Äôre just trying to figure out the basics.

So how does this mental model help you? How can you apply this to your day-to-day?

Open a dialogue with your management chain / leadership team about the product strategy and the type(s) of PM(s) necessary to bring it to fruition.

Introspect on where your strengths lie and where you‚Äôd like to take your career (by the way, it‚Äôs totally OK to specialize OR move back and forth)

Talk to your PM peers on the Purist / Tweener mix in your org and whether a shift is warranted / possible / inevitable

Product Delight: Brain Rewiring,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/product-delight-brain-rewiring,"This is going to be an ongoing series that highlights some characteristics and offshoots of ‚Äúproduct delight‚Äù.  The concept is critical to user engagement and business scaling, but tends to be amorphous until you experience it in practice. Through these posts I hope to point out trends that can help product builders identify if they‚Äôre on a path to generating delight or not.

I‚Äôve been listening to a lot of Brene Brown recently (it‚Äôs my pandemic / quarantine sanity playlist), and she had a guest on her podcast recently who shared a very simple yet very powerful idea:

the brain can rewire itself

(for many reasons through many mechanisms). Since I love to connect random ideas from different disciplines, it got me thinking about a pet theory of mine; successful product adoption is akin to building new neural pathways in the user‚Äôs brain, and taking it a step further, product delight means you‚Äôve permanently rewired the brain (hence the feeling of ‚Äúmagic‚Äù).

If you think about products in terms of the Jobs to be Done (JTBD) framework,

fit

is usage for the intended JTBD, and

delight

is usage for an unintended JTBD. Basically, when delighted, the user starts to see your product less as a single-purpose specialty tool and more as a multi-purpose utility tool.

One of my favorite physical (vs digital) world products is the Swiss Army Knife. The intended JTBD is in the name:

knife

. But if you‚Äôve ever owned one, you know that slowly but surely you start using it for all manner of unintended JTBDs, even ones where the tool doesn‚Äôt make sense. I personally have used the knife for everything from mud-scraping to glassess-repairing to fruit-cutting (not in that order). The point being, at some point, I as a user decided to utilize this product for ad-hoc scenarios because it‚Äôs a familiar pathway for my brain‚Äôs network to traverse.

Let‚Äôs walk through a digital example:

Excel

. Every SaaS product is ultimately competing with Excel, with getting users to stop thinking of their workflows in terms of spreadsheets. Why is change management in enterprise software so hard? Why are people so unwilling to give up their beloved spreadsheets? It‚Äôs because that application has delighted users for decades and completely rewired their brains.

‚Äúthe most commonly pressed buttons in any SaaS app are ‚ÄòOK‚Äô, ‚ÄòCancel‚Äô, and ‚ÄòExport to Excel‚Äô‚Äù

So the next time you‚Äôre thinking about product delight, be aware that you‚Äôre attempting nothing less than brain surgery!

Product Leadership Principles,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/product-leadership-principles,"Recently, I had a chat with a PM who had just moved into management, and they were asking me how I made certain decisions when it came to hiring, staffing, coaching, etc. The conversation prompted me to think through my latent product leadership principles (and biases) that I‚Äôd accumulated and refined over the years, which I‚Äôll be sharing here today.

I‚Äôve found these principles have both fascinated and frustrated the folks in my orgs over the years‚Ä¶

1/ iteration ¬ª ideation

I prefer bias for action over talking. Of all of Amazon‚Äôs (my first real product role) leadership principles, this one spoke to me the clearest and loudest. PM-ing, to me, is fundamentally about making good decisions over and over, which means you actually have to attempt things vs just brainstorm forever. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I don‚Äôt measure this by how much product you ship or how many features you launch, but rather that the team you‚Äôre leading is accumulating learnings through your direction (and learnings can come from launches, research, write-ups, prototypes, etc).

2/ system ¬ª sections

I enjoy understanding the end-to-end experience vs going deep on any 1 component. This mindset is what originally prompted me to switch from being an engineer (accountable for one portion of the system) to an architect (accountable for the entire system), and that techincal architecture mindset carried over into my initial forays into platform product management. Another way to say this, for perhaps a PM with a UX Design / Research background, is that products are workflows, and a lot of product innovation comes down to deconstructing and reconstructing workflows in novel ways.

3/ foundation ¬ª features

Thinking through ""building block"" investments (that will pay off multiple times in multiple ways) is way more interesting to me than short-term shiny objects. The systems thinking I highlighted above carries over into careful product planning and bet compounding - I appreciate PMs who know how to make

1+1 = 3

. You can layer product choices over time to compound value for your users / customers, just like you can exacerbate product debt over time by carrying it - foundational work is critical to both compound value and debt payoff.

4/ synthesis ¬ª status

I prefer insights over updates - don't recite a slide / table / chart that I can read for myself, enlighten me on what I missed because I didn't read between the lines. One of the most frustrating things for product leaders that IC PMs don‚Äôt understand is the flood of information - constant updates from innumerable channels on every topic make it so you can‚Äôt separate signal from noise. Most leaders either have to be either hyper operationally savvy to control the flow of information or hire someone to be a human filter. If there‚Äôs a real use case for AI in product development, I would bet it‚Äôs a synthetic agent that serves as a 2nd brain for CPOs. And this is why the most common advice I give PMs who are meeting with a product leader for the 1st time is

‚Äúmake 1 point and spend 30 minutes driving it home vs a hodgepodge of status updates‚Äù

.

5/ outcomes ¬ª output

This is a pretty standard one and the industry has really come around - move *the* needle vs *a* needle (metrics-wise). This one can is less a principle that people need to be convinced on, and more a philosopohy that‚Äôs hard to put into practice - most organizations are geared towards proxies for customer value because it‚Äôs too hard to show a direct link to customer value over the short term. I think PMs are in an especially tricky position because most functions can point to an output metric - every incremental marketing dollar has to generate more pipeline, every additional sales person is supposed to close more deals, and even more developers are supposed to ship more features - but every new PM should result in better quality outcomes, not in any added output.

6/ sustainable ¬ª sporadic

It‚Äôs unpopular, but I don‚Äôt think you should ‚Äúdo things that don‚Äôt scale‚Äù - you should do the bare minimum now to scale properly later. As hard as 0 to 1 innovation is, most companies plateau / atrophy not because of failiure to innovate, but rather failure to scale. Moreover, I think the PM function at a lot of companies discourages an ownership mindset by focusing on short-term feature shipping, which leads to accumulating product cruft and technical debt and ultimately constrains what might be built and how long it takes. I‚Äôm not sure why everyone is always interested in punting on scale - to survive long-term you have to scale.

7/ fluidity ¬ª firmness

I prefer strong opinions weakly held - but not the lip service kind - actual dispassionate evaluation of ideas / tactics with a willingness to pivot hard the minute you know you need to. This goes back to my view that PM-ing is fundamentally about making good decisions over and over, which is tough since many PMs have been incentivized to lock in on an early solution and ship at all costs.

8/ planning ¬ª plans

It‚Äôs the habit vs the actual plans that matter long term. If you‚Äôve been in a product organization long enough, you inevitably have a debate about why planning has to be quarterly or if annual planning is necessary - to me these are all snapshotting exercises that can be made simple with always having a now / next / later plan. When I look at roadmaps, I‚Äôm less interested in dates and more keen on what made the list and what didn‚Äôt, and why - one of my annoying line of questions is about the rationale used to prioritize a backlog vs the actual prioritized list.

9/ quality ¬ª quickness

Just like planning for scale, quality (usability, performance, cost) can‚Äôt be a bolt on after shipping - this is a not a data-based opinion, this is my own bias as a user (rough edges in a product grate on your over time and cause emotional churn in my opinion). I will acknowledge that many poor quality products have won the day with speed to market or feature velocity, but ultimately I would rather work on iconic products (many of which don‚Äôt ‚Äúwin‚Äù), and those always have quality that shines through.

10/ proxies ¬ª process

One of the functions of a PM is to form a perspective on the market any way they can - sticking to structured feedback rituals that don‚Äôt provide value is silly when there might be other / faster ways to learn about your target user / buyer. I‚Äôm not saying don't directly talk to your customer if you can as often as you can, I'm saying getting an ad-hoc pulse from sales / partners / analysts every so often is also a reasonable path. Customer experience learning loops come in many forms, and my view from a product leadership vantage point is breadth matters more than depth (the latter comes into play when you want to make sure you‚Äôre building the right solution after zero-ing in on a customer problem).

11/ direction ¬ª data

I love data, but it‚Äôs purpose is to provide direction, so worry about the higher order bit. Too many people get caught up in correctness over clarity - you just need enough signal to decide on a path - precision can come later when you're optimizing. Again, this is my mindset as a product leader - making sure we‚Äôre heading in the right direction generally vs trying to take the shortest next step every single time. I‚Äôve written extensively before on how I evaluate this competency when I interview PMs (see the link below on Data vs Intuition).

12/ loops ¬ª leaps

One-offs are exactly that -  moonshots don‚Äôt happen by accident, luck is manufactured by being 1% better every day. My personal biases strongly creep in here, but I prefer to see a string of good decisions vs a wild swing that happens to land - the former is skill, the latter is luck.

13/ writing ¬ª winging

If you can‚Äôt articulate it via an

n

-page doc, you haven‚Äôt thought it through deeply and are just winging it. You can hide in every medium (Powerpoint, Slack, Miro, Twitter) except a long-form document. This lesson was really driven home for me after having been the 1st PM to work with an engineering team multiple times in my career - for a PM to onboard successfully, they have to provide differentiated value, which only comes from clarity of thinking, which can only be confirmed through writing.

Product Market Flex,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/product-market-flex,"One of the hardest things for me to wrap my head around for a long time was the concept of ‚Äúproduct market fit‚Äù (PMF). It‚Äôs easy enough to describe: ‚Äúpull in the market for your product‚Äù. And I was told many a time that if I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúfeeling it‚Äù then I ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt have it‚Äù. But the job of a PM is to not only achieve PMF but sustain it over the life of a product as the market evolves - how are you supposed to do that when you can‚Äôt pinpoint where you stand and where you need to get to?

Then it hit me. PMF is transient, and you need to ‚Äúflex‚Äù your product muscles to get into the state required to do the lifting on behalf of the customer / user. I‚Äôll admit the weightlifting anology is a stretch (get it!), so let‚Äôs try some visuals‚Ä¶

The diagram above shows the evolution of a product vs the needs of the market.

At any given moment in time, even if you have PMF, you still need to be working towards a future state where the market has evolved, and your product has kept up.

In other words, the product capabilities need to line up with market maturity in order to have a fit - that‚Äôs my definition of PMF.

There will be times when your product is over-built for the current market need and a simpler solution would suffice.

And there will be times with the market needs more sophisticated capabilities and your product can‚Äôt meet expectations.

So what do you do if you end up in this mismatch of capabilities and maturity?

Well, this is the heart of ‚Äúproduct work‚Äù (which is done not only by PMs but Design, Engineering, GTM, etc).

There are 2 dimensions on which we can flex to achieve PMF.

Reduce the effort required by the user to get value

Increase the literacy level of your target user base

The R&D and GTM bets that you make should be designed to reduce effort / increase literacy respectively. In a future post I‚Äôll cover some case studies and strategies for doing this successfuly, but the biggest takeaway is that achieving and sustaining PMF is likely a combination of effort-reducing and literacy-increasing bets made in conjunction.

tl;dr R&D and GTM teams should be coordinating on PMF

I heard you have a product for me? That‚Äôs great - I have so many problems you can solve for me. I‚Äôd love to gauge if we‚Äôre a fit.

You‚Äôve already got a handle on all my problems? But we barely know each other. There‚Äôs so much I have to tell you. I have so many‚Ä¶edge cases.

A roadmap? Listen, I like that you‚Äôre so organized, but I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôve thought about all my issues the way you have - it all feels so structured and sequenced. I‚Äôm still figuring myself out‚Ä¶maybe we could talk about it some more?

You don‚Äôt think we need to talk about it? I think some research would help you approach me with less friction. I know everyone is product-led these days, but I‚Äôm a bit old-fashioned‚Ä¶

Oh, I didn‚Äôt realize research was so expensive and a waste of time. I was thinking we‚Äôd keep it lightweight, just a few conversations with users in my inner circle.

You talked to an admin who talked to a buyer who said they had some budget? Ok, I‚Äôm not sure those folks truly understand what I‚Äôm struggling with‚Ä¶

You think they represent me? I‚Äôm not following - what gave you confidence that they speak for me?

SAM? Who is SAM?

Addressable? All my problems are addressable! Just because some of them can‚Äôt be immediately monetized doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre not worth talking about. If you‚Äôll just spend some time listening to what I have to say, I‚Äôm sure we can find a fit.

You think revenue represents fit? Ok, I‚Äôm not sure about that - just because someone is paying you claiming to solve a problem for me, doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm getting value.

You‚Äôre right, I haven‚Äôt heard your value proposition. Can you tell me more?

It‚Äôs the same as the competition, but cheaper? OK - I guess cost matters a little bit, but there are so many other things I have to take into consideration when I choose a product.

Packaging? Ok, I think that helps your sellers, not my users. I‚Äôm not sure why you keep telling me how much easier it is to buy - I‚Äôm still hung up on fit.

AI? I don‚Äôt think I even know what I want in terms of AI. Just becuase everyone else is doing it doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm ready for that. Can we talk about change management - I‚Äôve got a lot of users who will need to re-learn things.

Casuals? That‚Äôs a disrespectful term! All my users matter. It‚Äôs strange that you only want to listen to the powerful ones. Honestly, some references I spoke to think this is all just going to end in‚Ä¶churn. You need to start paying attention to my needs!

Experiment? But my users didn‚Äôt sign up to be experimented on! In fact, we‚Äôd prefer consistency and quality and reliability over all this superficial change.

That‚Äôs not what your leadership team thinks? What do they know about me?!? I‚Äôve heard them speak - they talk about me like I‚Äôm just a means to an end!

They read about me? Where??

Gartner and Forrester? Are they friends of SAM?

Oh, I do remember getting some calls from those analysts - I let it go to voicemail. I think you might have an oversimplified view of me based on big assumptions and old information. It really would be easier if we could just communicate directly, product to market.

Your website? I‚Äôm not visiting your website. None of my users are championing you, so I‚Äôm not sure why I would go to all that effort and spend more time learning about you. My time is precious - I‚Äôve got a job to be done. Do you even know what that is??

Your campaign messages? Yeah, I vaguely recall those. I don‚Äôt spend much time on those channels, so those messages kind of get ignored.

You paid someone for access to me?? Umm, that‚Äôs kind of desperate. I‚Äôm gonna be blunt, I‚Äôm barely even aware of you. I get a lot of mixed messages about you from users I trust.

ICP! Woah woah - are you some sort of weirdo?

Ideal customer? You actually think we‚Äôre ready to get‚Ä¶contractual? I don‚Äôt know that I want to be your‚Ä¶customer. I need more than‚Ä¶pixels. And you don‚Äôt really bring anything else to the table.

Yes, yes, we did do that pilot. But it didn‚Äôt mean anything. I had to export to CSV just to complete my workflow.

$1M in ARR? Ok, I‚Äôm not sure why my admin paid you that much for a proof of concept, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ready to move forward with a more serious commitment.

3 year deal? Listen, this is all moving kind of fast for me - maybe I‚Äôll go to talk to this other product over here. They seem meaningfully differentiated and well adopted.

pop quiz! You have an API product providing data to your customers. They do ""stuff"" with that data but you don't get to see what happens for the ultimate end user. Leadership's only benchmark is revenue. What's your north star metric?

I managed an API product where leadership‚Äôs only benchmark was revenue! And on my first day on the job everyone was trying to figure out the north star metric! Is this guy reading my mind?!

Matthew Steer

@otteradrift

@onejasonknight

Hm. Your API exists so you can provide some kind of service. That service meets a need. You say ""...providing data to your customers"". I can't answer your question if I don't know what data. Because that data is the user need you are meeting. The north star metric is in there.

2:39 PM ‚àô Mar 10, 2022

LOL. This guy is bringing product thinking to a revenue party. Your customer does ‚Äústuff‚Äù. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt get to see what happens for the ultimate end users‚Äù - the constraint is spelled out in the question. It‚Äôs B2B2C. Maybe even B2D2C (your customer is a developer business like an ISV or SI). Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs the right instinct to try to connect the dots to the end user workflow, but this is Twitter - the answer is going to be short and sweet, not ‚Äúdo user research‚Äù.

Scott D. Witt

Followup Question:
Why is Revenue leadership's only benchmark?
And why is that? (5whys)
Obviously Revs are important to the biz, but it may be unreliable b/c it's a function of the Pricing, which may also be faulty.

4:31 PM ‚àô Mar 10, 2022

hahahahahaha - in B2B products, you have to connect to revenue (generation or preservation)

mirza besirovic üá∫üá¶

@miryabesirovix

@onejasonknight

It would have to be API calls, but we'd need to go granular to draw a line to a meaningful conclusion. What kind of call? What time of day? What customer? Verticals? Etc. 

Also, while leadership may not care about end users, I'd still go out and find a way to talk to them

12:49 PM ‚àô Mar 11, 2022

We‚Äôre now assuming that API usage connects to revenue, but we haven‚Äôt confirmed that. I love, love, love ‚ÄúI‚Äôd still go out and find a way to talk to end users‚Äù, but you have to talk to your internal sales team first (probably quicker too).

Andrew Chant

@onejasonknight

My north star metric could be the number of daily active users, number of signups and retention and I'd also like to determine the customer lifetime value.

1:39 PM ‚àô Mar 10, 2022

one metric! the quiz asked for a north star metric - this is a mix of leading indicators, lagging outcomes, and tension metrics

@dcerecedo

@onejasonknight

How does the API make revenue? Is it requests, clients, other?
NS can be revenue but you could use a proxy metric based on how your business model generates it. i.e. requests: measure daily reqests and you get daily feedback on how you will deliver revenue end of month.

12:54 PM ‚àô Mar 10, 2022

Now we‚Äôre getting somewhere. If revenue is the goal, we need to understand the product usage ‚Üí revenue link. And I love the idea of a proxy metric, because the product team can control product activation / adoption / engagement, but actual revenue is the result of many other factors beyond the product team‚Äôs sphere of influence. I was surprised no one said ‚Äúrevenue‚Äù is the north star - it makes a certain sort of sense, but would completely demoralize and gut the product team over the long-term.

Jason Knight üíîüá∫üá¶

@onejasonknight

@dcerecedo

Let's assume the product is sold on a 2 year contract basis, unlimited usage

3:13 PM ‚àô Mar 10, 2022

The next layer of the onion is revealed‚Ä¶Now we know usage has nothing to do with revenue.

Aya

@onejasonknight

Time to first successful API call (reflects onboarding, documentation, support), uptime

1:56 PM ‚àô Mar 11, 2022

Nice try, but no. Since we don‚Äôt care if the product is actually used, trying to optimize the activation journey is pointless. Note: I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs bad thinking, I‚Äôm saying this is a very constrained product problem and you can‚Äôt just redefine the parameters based on how you like to operate.

frostybyte

@0xbad1dead

@onejasonknight

If revenue is benchmarked and it‚Äôs an api metric the norstart metric has to be usage as pricing is usage based typically for api products

4:28 PM ‚àô Mar 10, 2022

I‚Äôm pretty sure he said unlimited usage. How API products are ‚Äútypically‚Äù priced has no bearing here. Many, many, many PMs can‚Äôt get over how things are ‚Äúsupposed to be‚Äù. Play the hand your dealt.

Andy Nyberg

@AndyNybs

@onejasonknight

I feel like you have to get to an engagement metric that short cuts the 2 year contract period - churn maybe? - and couple that with something qual like CSat.

12:07 PM ‚àô Mar 11, 2022

Ok, I like the attempt to break out of the Matrix. Something revenue-ish (churn) to meet leadership where they are. But churn is not a great metric because it‚Äôs laggy. It‚Äôs about business health, not product focus.

Mike Chowla

@mchowla

@onejasonknight

I don‚Äôt see a good metric.

API calls - making the API more efficient for devs may take 3 calls and turn it into 1.  Metric goes down but value goes up

Customers using - maybe the customers are only using it because of missing core product functionality and API is a workaround

3:27 AM ‚àô Mar 11, 2022

I‚Äôve seen it before - PMs just throwing up their hands and saying ‚Äúno good metric‚Äù. It‚Äôs really, really hard to connect a product team‚Äôs work clearly to a top-level outcome (like revenue).

Dara Alsulayman

@DAlsulayman

@onejasonknight

Since the product offers unlimited usage and a 2 year contract I would potentially look at a function of acquisition and retention so something like a Quick Ratio (New+Resurrected)/Churned

8:00 AM ‚àô Mar 11, 2022

So, let‚Äôs make the metric complicated and hope people don‚Äôt notice it doesn‚Äôt correlate to revenue generation / preservation?

Kirsten Minshall

@KirstenMinshall

@onejasonknight

Why wouldn't leadership be interested in the value the API provides to end users? Just because it's abstracted by a third party doesn't mean the value doesn't exist...

1:23 PM ‚àô Mar 10, 2022

LOL. So much LOL!

Jason Knight üíîüá∫üá¶

@onejasonknight

@KirstenMinshall

Let's assume they're not uninterested, but consider it difficult to measure and are using revenue ( / retention) as a proxy - which is fair enough but they have 2 year contracts so difficult to move that with shorter term product initiatives

1:26 PM ‚àô Mar 10, 2022

OK, stop LOL-ing. Leadership is a hard job. Sometimes you‚Äôre painted in a corner with constraints the team can‚Äôt see / understand. The center of the onion is very pungent - not everyone can see / smell it without crying‚Ä¶

I'm not a big fan of a (single) North Star metric, b/c they are very contextually dependent & picking a poor one (even though you think it may be a good one) can lead to problems.

Sebastian Sandoval Simil√§

@sebastian_j_ss

I would look at unique users per day over unique requests, especially as sometimes the high number of requests can be an indication of an inefficient integration or endpoint. In fact a new endpoint can decrease usage of old ones, which would be a win

Basically, where are you now is a function of the choices you‚Äôve made in the past, but fixating on the prior roads not taken is pointless, because there‚Äôs no wishing your way into a different past‚Ä¶but, many, many choices remain to be made, and that‚Äôs where you should focus your energy.

Here is my attempt to redraw this with a PM framing:

How can you apply this to your product craft?

Original Opportunity:

you can get so caught up in the decision paths you‚Äôre currently facing that you forget about the original customer problem you were trying to solve - does it still exist and how has it evolved?

Lifecycle Phase:

the reason for evaluating future branches (i.e. product paths) can vary based on what stage (starting, scaling, sustaining) your product is at, and keeping that in mind can help you find the most efficient path to the next iteration

Sunset Stage:

if you don‚Äôt see any good paths ahead, or they all seem inconsequential, your product may have plateaued

Discovery Work:

sometimes you don‚Äôt know if or how far you want to go down a path, and discovery (vs delivery) work is how you gauge that - building product is the most expensive way to discovery by the way, and cheaper alternatives include prototyping, wireframing, and handwaving

Just-in-Time Decisioning:

just because you started going down a path doesn‚Äôt mean you have to double down - backtracking is an option if you learn along the way that you took a sub-optimal path, and while there is a short-term cost to unwinding, it can be cheaper than long-term commitment to the wrong route

Layering Choices:

it‚Äôs a fallacy to think of every decision as an independent one; they all compound, and a series of good ones have a multiplicative effect and a series of bad ones create a drag on a product team

Debt Paydown:

if you‚Äôve made a series of ‚Äúbad‚Äù choices and have accrued product debt, you have to take a beat, pause, and clean up vs continuing to throw good money after bad

Product Sense,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/product-sense,"Product Sense is a recurring topic for PMs, whether you‚Äôre starting out in your career or operating as a seasoned executive. Sid (aka

@JustAnotherPM

) and I (aka

@ibscribe

) spent some time thinking through why it matters and how to refine the skill, and co-wrote the post below‚Ä¶

What is product sense?

In product management, there is rarely a ""perfect solution""...so then how do product managers know what solution to build?

It‚Äôs one thing to look back and decide whether a solution worked. But it is another thing to look forward and create solutions that, we hope, will work.

That is product sense at its core: the ability to create solutions today, with limited information, that will solve the user's problems tomorrow, and keep solving them in the foreseeable future.

Let‚Äôs unpack this a little more. Product sense is the ability to:

Identify a consistent (behavior-wise) set of users

Understand the biggest user needs and problems

Have a logical rationale for each problem identified

Think of creative solutions for the above problems

Objectively lay the pros/cons for each option

Select the one that makes the most sense for the user

While connecting user value back to business outcomes

Based on the above diagram, you can also view product sense as a combination of user sense + business sense + market sense.

Now that we have a theoretical definition, let's look at how this translates into the real world. Consider a scenario where you, as a product manager of a

new

social media app, are trying to choose between feature A or feature B to increase the total time spent on the app.

You can choose one or the other with a high degree of confidence if you have excellent product sense. Similarly, if you had to select design 1 or design 2, it would be an easy choice if you have excellent product sense.

Does that mean product managers with good product sense always have the best answer? No.

But it does mean that PMs with good product sense also know when they do not have the required knowledge to make the right decisions. In such cases, they usually work with others to acquire more information to reduce ambiguity.

With that said, product sense is

not

an exact science. There is no practical way to know which solutions will be the best in a given scenario. Two product managers with excellent product sense will, in all probability, have different solutions to a given problem.

The orange boxes in the diagram above are the most challenging components of product sense. And that is because ambiguity at this stage is extremely high. The other boxes in the diagram representing other aspects (like execution, analytics, experimentation, etc.) are comparatively easier because you usually have more comprehensive data or a more complete picture when making a decision.

Why is product sense important?

The simplest way to answer this question is -- good product sense is the difference between making the

best series of decisions

that lead to a near-ideal solution to solve the user's problem vs making decisions that may or may not have any impact. And for that reason, product sense is always easier to judge in hindsight.

Product sense exists at every level -- minor feature enhancements, major product changes, new product launches, or defining the overall product strategy. So irrespective of your level (PM, Senior PM, Group PM, etc), having good product sense is critical for making the right decisions.

As you go up the ladder, the impact of product sense increases. Good decisions from the top will foster good decisions at lower levels. At a VP level, good product sense will lead to sound strategic decisions that will directly impact most, if not all, tactical decisions that PMs, Senior PMs, and Group PMs make. Unfortunately, the inverse is also true; bad decisions will make the entire team move in the wrong direction.

Remember Blackberry? What do you think led to their demise? Terrible product sense.

They failed because they did not anticipate the rise of the iPhone and Android smartphones. Even after iPhone's and Android's popularity, Blackberry chose to refrain from innovating or adapting to changing market trends. They overlooked the most crucial aspect of product sense -- understanding the user's needs.

During that time period (2007-2008), users wanted touch screens, multiple apps, and a better online experience. Blackberry ignored all of that, while others capitalized on the changes in user behavior, business models, and market trends (again, product sense = user sense + business sense + market sense).

While Blackberry is an extreme example, the larger point is that lousy product sense compounds negatively over time. It leads to an increase in accumulation of tech debt and risk of user churn, while corresponding to a negative impact on the business. In most cases, it forces the company into a spiral where it becomes harder and harder to dig out of the compounding effect of a series of sub-optimal decisions.

What are some common myths about product sense?

Even today, product sense is one of the lesser-understood aspects of product management. As a result, a few common myths about it persist:

Product managers are born with product sense:

While some people may have a natural inclination towards understanding user needs, it's also a skill that can be developed and improved over time. (More on this below)

Product sense is

only

about intuition:

What we might think is intuition is actually a mix of multiple things like historical context, general awareness, deep understanding of users, data analysis, and understanding of the market, among other things.

Product sense is only needed for certain types of products:

In our experience (across various industries and products), product sense is essential for all kinds of products, from physical goods to desktop software to back-end services.

How can you build up your product sense?

Now that we‚Äôve dispelled the myth that product sense can‚Äôt be built or refined, let‚Äôs talk about ways to actually build the muscle. Since we split product sense into user sense, business sense, and market sense, we need to look at the ways each of those sub-skills can be built up:

User Sense

Use the product yourself regularly for a breadth of use cases

Watch user‚Äôs use the product live or async (qualitative input)

Analyze segments of user‚Äôs with behavioral data (quantitative input)

Read user feedback around product bugs and features requests

Business Sense

Talk to current / prospective / former customers to understand buyer behavior

Talk to the folks that serve as intermediaries to customers (sales/support/partners)

Market Sense

Understand current headwinds / tailwinds and developing trends in the industry

Read win / loss reports from sales, read churn forecasts from CS

Absorb your competitor‚Äôs roadmap and reverse engineer their strategy / beliefs

In order for a PM to develop great product sense, a few conditions have to be true for the product org:

PMs get to talk to and observe users regularly and directly in their local environment

User Research is a discipline in the org (funded centrally or through embedded model)

PMs have access to a self-serve behavioral analytics tool and/or Data Science time

User feedback is collected, collated, and synthesized regularly with a review ritual

PMs either understand commercial strategy or work with GTM peers who clarify

PMs have access to industry trend reports and competitive intel through partners

Now the manner in which you access all these sense-building avenues varies on your role / level:

New PM

More inclined towards direct user access

Smaller surface (less breadth) but going deep

Tightly scoping research sprints

Seasoned PM

Focus on avoiding getting into traps

Talking to same customers over and over

Relying on past insights for too long

Expand into adjacencies vs core (PMF expansion)

Product Leader

Low depth across a broad surface area (portfolio)

Focus on long-term action to take from forecasts

i.e. what does your product sense tell you to build / deprecate in a multi-year time horizon (vs sprint / quarter view)

Think about framing current view -> future view

What actually changes?

Why does it matter?

What does it mean for the business + user base?

But no matter the methods you utilize to get better at product sense, it all fundamentally comes down to reps (repetitions) - every PM at every level needs regular opportunities to exercise product sense to refine the skill. And the best way to ensure everyone in the product org is getting reps (both quality and quantity) is to ritual-ize it. Some rituals to considering establishing:

Learning review: a regular check-in where product decisions are re-visited to gauge impact and course correct (again, product sense can only be judged in hindsight)

Interlock with cross-functional partners: every department has access to different information and develops a slightly different perspective on the user / business / market, so regular touchpoints with internal partners are a great way to round out product sense

Expose PMs directly to customers: whenever an intermediary (sales/support/research) is used to help translate user needs for PMs, something is lost in translation‚Ä¶so while proxies for customer pain are valuable in terms of speed and coverage, it‚Äôs critical that PMs find ways to directly interact with users in the wild and form a direct point of view on the pain they are dealing with

Resume Revisionism,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/resume-revisionism,"More and more of my writing is now inspired by readers who send me questions - keep it up!

Recent mailbag question:

Does the market value of an individual whose startup fails go up or down? Is the company failure seen as individual weakness? What is the perception when he/she goes out to find a job in the corporate world?

This, to me, is really a question about how to tell a narrative. And the complexity comes from the intersecting narratives: your career

x

your company.

My inclination is to focus on the career arc vs any one company, but I know enough about biases to know that‚Äôs not how it works; the right (or wrong) company can completely make (or break) your narrative. When I worked at Amazon, no one thought much of it (Seattle was a total Microsoft zone, and most press around Amazon was negative) - but now I tend to be label-ed as ‚Äúex-Amazon‚Äù, in a good way (even though it was a 10 years and 3 jobs ago). I‚Äôm not complaining (because my career gets to bask in the afterglow of Amazon‚Äôs success), but it‚Äôs important to acknowledge that people‚Äôs career narratives can be tanked by even passing exposure to the wrong brand. So the question from the reader is very legitimate‚Ä¶

For anyone facing a similar choice (thinking about taking a job with narrative implications unclear, or in a situation where there‚Äôs a negative veneer that you‚Äôre not sure will ever lift), my guidance is the following:

narratives are inherently fluid and markets are always evolving

: the upstart of today could be the category leader of tomorrow, every incumbent is eventually disrupted, etc‚Ä¶you have to make peace with the fact that part of resume revisions is refining the narrative so that it all makes sense in hindsight

narratives can be told from different altitudes

: most resume advice I give to people is to pick the level they want to be operating at and then tell their story of bets placed and impact made from that vantage point‚Ä¶by the way this is a great way to gauge whether you are operating at a particular level - can you tell the story of the business from that altitude?

narratives need to fit a digestible pattern

: human being are great at pattern matching, which is why there is so much bias / automation in hiring processes - we look for certain schools or companies to create a correlation to competence, and we look for associations with certain terms or people to suss out risk

So what is a person that is astutely trying to manage their career to do? My formula (which I learned through trial and error) is to focus on your learning objectives. Whatever decisions you make, whatever jobs you take, whatever roles you fill, whatever projects you work on, etc can all be reconciled around your learning goals. If you end up somewhere that‚Äôs a ‚Äúdrain‚Äù on a resume and someone asks why you ever went there (as if it was obvious years before), the most credible answer is because you were trying to learn something. And I will totally acknowledge that it‚Äôs a privilege to make learning potential your top criteria in a job search - for many people it‚Äôs income, flexibility, commute, health, etc‚Ä¶but in those cases, focus on your needs (survival) vs future narratives (thrival).

the idea that your criteria for job satisfaction shifts over time is something I‚Äôve talked about before in an audio episode:

Personal North Star Metrics

one thing I hope comes across in this post is that even when saddled with a ‚Äúbad company‚Äù you can create a coherent narrative - I‚Äôve talked about a similar idea with regards to product development (

failure is a type of learning that you aren‚Äôt ready to understand yet

, so take the time and space to gain perspective)

pitching your point of view

, which I shared previously as a lesson for product builder and marketers, applies to career narratives and resume revisions too

RTB Blueprint,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/rtb-blueprint,"Recently, a reader asked how how I choose what to write about; basically, it comes down to whatever is on my mind. I have 2 primary modes when it comes to creating:

Seeking - when a topic intrigues me, I go hunting for as much information as I can find on it and write about it as a way to clarify my own understanding

Surfacing - I randomly read the

n

-th article on a topic, and since I tag everything I read, through serendipity I have a critical mass of notes I can synthesize

But what the reader who reached out was struggling with was the randomness of it all. Wasn‚Äôt there a blueprint of the types of topics I would consider writing about?

So here we go - a mindmap of how I‚Äôm (currently) thinking about this newsletter:

As you can see, there are 7 major buckets my writing falls into:

Self

- tips from my learning mindset and attempts to get 1% better every day

Communication

- this is perhaps the most critical skill for a knowledge worker today and the main reason why I started writing (and publishing)

Leadership

- a lot of my observations and advice around things I notice in companies (both ones I‚Äôve worked in / studied from afar) fall into this category

Talent

- nothing gets done without people, and this topic is evergreen

Strategy

- thoughtful focus and deliberate emphasis around what you choose to do (and not do) is the highest-leverage aspect of running a business

Execution

- we (myself included) tend to default to this mode, so plenty of lessons to share based on things that went right (and wrong)

Data

- I love to quantify things, and this is less of a stand-alone grouping but rather something that gets woven into lots of brackets

I‚Äôd love to hear from readers on what branches I should add / dive into more - please chime in via commentsüëá. And if you enjoyed this post, please consider

Run the Business Half Year Review,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/run-the-business-half-year-review,"It‚Äôs been an interesting 6 months where I‚Äôve been pouring more energy into this newsletter and also experimenting with new concepts. I‚Äôm stealing a page from other creators and doing a recap of the 1st half of the year for readers who may have missed things (or new subscribers who may not be familiar with the whole catalog).

I‚Äôve been checking in with readers more directly on what they find valuable, especially my most engaged readers (Substack analytics and the app have been quite useful here), and it seems the nuances of building and scaling B2B products is something folks find I have a unique voice for. One very popular most I wrote in that vein was about how AI can help you get into the revenue path quicker / easier, and that could potentially be an unlock for value-based pricing. You can read the whole essay

here

and there‚Äôs a robust discussion on LinkedIn around this post as well -

check it out and chime in

as well.

Longtime readers know that I‚Äôve been

writing

and

speaking

about how to connect B2B product work to revenue (generation, preservation, sustainability) for a long time - I actually distilled all that thinking into a keynote that I gave at ProductCon New York in May - check out the whole talk below:

You can see the slides from my ProductCon presentation

here

and I wrote

a recap with some guidance on how to apply the framework in practice here

- ultimately all R&D (and GTM) folks are just trying to

connect daily decisions to the bottom line

.

But I still really enjoy musing about general product management topics, and I had 2 posts recently that name some obvious anti-patterns and offer a path out.

, which delves into the downside of talking to your customers too much and ending up building a niche product for power users

The most popular episode of

60 Minute Stories

by far was

my discussion with Anurag Wadehra on layering AI into your B2B product and motion

, which is a topic many PM and GTM leaders are grappling with these days. The audience Q&A in this session was particularly insightful since a lot of leaders have already attempted to invest here. The clip below has

Anurag

highlighting how human involvement in the feedback loop is what slows down most workflows. You can learn more from Anurag via his

Growth Matters newsletter

.

I also went back to my

Amazon roots

and chatted with

Liz Fireman

about

the convergence of hardware and software PMs for connected devices

. The clip below is us talking through how a new product might enter a crowded market vs big players.

Between my experience on the Kindle (a reimagined reading ecosystem) and Liz‚Äôs work at ARENA (a smart home gym) we were able to talk through some interesting trends, constraints, and possibilities with connected devices, including:

the different business models for monetizing (hardware vs subscription etc)

industries that are primed for new connected products to disrupt status quo

companies which do a great job with the end-to-end experience and how

the IoT devices hall of shame and what issues lead to unnecessary smart products

the different mentalities / realities of hardware PMs in comparison to software PMs

org design and how it can be both helpful and a hindrance to shipping quality UX

The most recent episode of

60 Minute Storie

s digs into a topic that I had not seen much public knowledge sharing about: M&A. It‚Äôs a subject on which there is not much accessible literature, because the people involved are too busy innovating or operating, so it was really eye-opening to get a first-hand account of how a deal comes together. I have 2 former Box co-workers who were generous enough to walk me through the 2 sides of the transaction: (1)

a head of corporate development representing an acquirer

and (2)

a startup CEO representing the acquiree

.

There were also some interesting frameworks / heursitics shared in the session if this something you‚Äôre tasked with executing. One that stood out for me was the 4 types of deals and how to frame the question of whether the deal makes sense differently for each of them:

talent - how does it accelerate the area of focus?

IP - what does it unlock from a capabilities lens?

existing product - how does it grow our business?

new market - how much of a head start do we get?

paid

) insights on all the topics laid out in

I did a

video episode

with

Jon Harmer from Google

recently on

critical user journeys

(CUJs), and during the conversation we hit on an interesting angle that I wanted to share more around: sacred workflows.

What is a sacred workflow? In your product, it‚Äôs THE golden path that you want / need every user to travel - the most critical of all user journeys. It likely is the foundation for all other workflows in your product, the flywheel through which all adjacencies converge, and the core driver of revenue generation. It‚Äôs the thing that you have all sorts of reliability / performance / quality monitoring set up around, and the trigger for people getting paged when there‚Äôs an issue. In short, it‚Äôs a really, really big deal.

But then why don‚Äôt all product companies treat it that way? Why are some organizations willing to take the risk of upsetting their core user base by playing with the sanctity of this workflow?

The answer, I believe, has to do with how deeply the tribal knowledge around this workflow is codified and ritualized. When you‚Äôve had to grind to find product-market fit (PMF), that learning needs to be preserved so that you can continue to compound on that initial insight as PMF shifts over time.

In the video example above, I talk about the customer experience bar raiser program at Amazon, which among other things kept an eye on the order pipeline (the sacred workflow of Amazon.com). It was essentially a committee made up of the folks who had worked on all major iterations of the checkout flow, who were now helping steer newbies like me who wanted to introduce changes. From the outside, it may sound like an onerous process and gatekeeping, but as someone new to Amazon, it was a crash course in the key learnings that had helped grow the site into the leading e-commerce platform. At some point, someone at Amazon had the foresight to realize that it would be a waste of time for the company and friction for users if new product development didn‚Äôt take advantage of best practices learned over the years.

Since that instance ~ 15 years ago, I‚Äôve always been observant when I join new companies around how they preserve canonical product insights and educate new employees on the sacred workflow. For example, having worked at Twitter (I refuse to call it ‚ÄúX‚Äù), I noticed early that there was no alignment around what the heart of the service was (this is a longer, future post); some people thought it was creator broadcasting, others saw it as user consumption, and even more focused on advertising as the actual revenue driver. But the fact that there was no company-wide alignment or education around the sacred workflow meant that changes were ideated on and introduced to users that ultimately were wasted product calories. Further, for a company trying to scale revenue and establish itself as a public business, it was very difficult to reason about business continuity, test coverage, service monitoring, latency improvements, and capacity planning when ‚Äúall features matter‚Äù.

Over the last several years, operating as a product executive, I‚Äôve come to the realization that it‚Äôs now my job to introduce rituals and best practices around the sacred worfklows of the products in my portfolio. When I joined Amplitude, partly out of necessity as someone onboarding remotely during the pandemic, I picked the brains of early employees to understand which customer conversations had led to the building of the core, differentiated feature set (the most used and demoed ones). I was pleasantly surprised to learn that a lot of these insights had been recorded either verbatim in notes or research calls. I was able to actually collate them together into a reading / play list which new PMs could then consume as they onboarded; in just a couple of hours, you could watch the greatest hits (in terms of customer insights) that had taken a decade to play out in real time. As you accumulate knowledge bills in a product organization, the most potent ones should be around the sacred workflow.

One angle I‚Äôm still exploring is how to create an Amazon-style culture around the sacred workflow. That to me is a final and necessary step to ensure that the sacred workflow is maintained by future employees once the old guard is gone The original product team being around to caution and direct new builders isn‚Äôt sustainable or scalable; Amazon was an anomaly in that way. I‚Äôm a big fan of the brain trust concept that Pixar apparently employs to ensure solid storytelling, and I think techniques like that down to ‚Äúpass down‚Äù tribal knowledge are how you ensure future PMs don‚Äôt repeat the mistakes of the past.

Savior Syndrome,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/savior-syndrome,"Last year, someone on my team explained the ‚ÄúBozone Layer‚Äù to me; basically, there is an approach that some folks (usually execs) employ that is more pontification vs. empowerment. It‚Äôs my professional nightmare to end up in the Bozone Layer, and I try very hard to stay cognizant of the behaviors that may eventually lead to that state.

I‚Äôve noticed in our current (Covid) climate that hot takes are spicier than ever, with a lot of ‚Äúthought leadership‚Äù on what this means historically and for the future, and tons of prognostication on topics by folks whose domain knowledge is limited. It reminds me of an essay I‚Äôd written years ago, mostly for myself, to come to terms with a particular brand of tone-deaf management I‚Äôd been dealing with. I‚Äôm re-publishing here, in the hopes that it gets a knowing smile from anyone who reads it.

Would love feedback on the narrative technique I experimented with‚Ä¶

Hey! I'm your savior!

You don't need saving? Ah, a skeptic I see. We had some skeptics at my last company. Different place, same problems.

Your problems are different? Not sure about that. From what I've seen it's the same old story. That was a company, this is a company. There were employees there, there are employees here. Do I need to continue listing the similarities?

Well, yeah, I've only been here a week...not sure what that has to do with anything? A week is plenty of time to get the lay of the land.

You betcha I'm going to talk to people. How else will I get data to validate the opinions I've already formed?

Am I joking? Not sure I follow. We've got an org to turn around - no time for jokes. It's all outlined in my 27 point plan.

You haven't read my plan? But I shared a Google doc with

everyone@thiscompany.com

. Oh, you're pulling my leg! You really had me going...

Now, as I was saying, the whole strategy is laid out in my 27 point plan. And the keys to the plan are items 7, 11, 5, 21-26, and 19 - I call it Phase II.

Why don't I make it a 10 point plan with just those priorities and just one phase? Well, I think I was brought in for more than 10 bullets and 1 phase. People are looking to me to give them multiple phases. And I'm going to phase the hell out of them!

How do I know this is the right thing to do? Well, for starters, I'm in charge, so my ideas must be better - everyone else is probably blinded by being too close to the problems and dealing with them day in and day out.

Metrics? What do #s have to do with this? This is about people. And process. We've got to rethink our people process. And how we process people. The people need process. And the process needs people. You follow me?

Exactly. I can tell you agree with me by the way you're shaking your head. You know, it's great to talk to someone who gets it. I have a feeling that before I got here nobody had the sense to recognize any of these problems. That's what being a savior is - pointing out obvious things that obviously haven't come up before.

They have come up before? That's news to me. I doubt it was a very serious conversation if I wasn't involved.

You're right, let's get back on track. I know my plan will work because I did the exact same thing at my last company and it worked there. I did a survey after the rollout of Phase II and 100% of the respondents were not completely negative.

What do you mean that place is a mess? You don't know anything about that place. You wouldn't have lasted 2 weeks there.

I don't get what you mean when you say I just proved your point. Let's stay focused on the plan, Bob.

Your name's not Bob?

Well, whatever your name is, I like your gumption. I'm putting you in charge of Phase II.

You're already on too many useless committees? Haha, I love your sense of humor Bob! That's why we've gotten along so well since I started here.

This is the first time we've spoken? I think your memory is failing you Bob - you're gonna need to stay sharp to execute Phase III.

It doesn't matter how many phases there are. What's key is that we show progress.

I'm not familiar with that term. Illusion of progress. I like it. Makes me sound like a magician.

I don't think I am oversimplifying. How can you oversimplify something that's pretty darn simple to begin with? There's a formula to success - you just follow the script. Trust me, I've succeeded nearly half the times I've followed this recipe.

It doesn't matter what happened in the other instances. There are no lessons there - just people who questioned the recipe. You can't have too many cooks in the kitchen; we're running a restaurant here!

Yes, I know we're not really running a restaurant. But we have a cafeteria here, don't we? There's food. I'll let you connect the dots.

Of course I know what business we're in. The details don't matter - we had this conversation all the time at my last company. That's what I'm trying to tell you - I was there and now I'm here, so we should repeat exactly what I saw unfold before.

There you go again with your talk of context and circumstances. All that matters is results.

Of course I can guarantee results! How else do you think I got this job??

Damn straight I'm gonna do some damage! That's my calling card. You should have seen my last company before I got there. You know, they had a guy there just like you Bob - he also asked a lot of questions that didn't need answering. I'm trying to make you an ally Bob - running Phase IV is going to make sure you and I get on the same page that I'm already on.

How did you know the other Bob didn't last long? Anyhoo, can you send me the notes you've been taking during our talk? I tend to forget key parts of my plan and it's good to have it all written down for reference.

What do you mean they're not notes? What's this app you're using? What's #SMH?

Where are you going? Bob? Come back!

Hey! I'm your savior!

SCARF Management,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/scarf-management,"This weekend, I got a call from a former team member who was new to managing people and was trying to figure out how to approach a new direct report. A chance to explain one of my favorite

mindbending models

: SCARF!

Status

Certainty

Autonomy

Relatedness

Fairness

The SCARF model attempts to summarize neurological processes in all our brains that are designed to maximize rewards / minimize threats. Basically, it boils down the handful of things that make people tick, in the context of professional fulfillment. And my own take, which is not supported by the research linked below, is that individuals tend to have 1 primary SCARF dimension when it comes to their careers; basically, there‚Äôs a core driver behind anyone‚Äôs workplace behavior. And if you can identify where they stand on the motivation spectrum, it becomes much easier to serve as their manager.

So let‚Äôs dig into each aspect, and I‚Äôll focus specifically on how it plays into team dynamics.

[1] Status

When an employee‚Äôs perception is anchored on where they stand relative to others, Status is their primary driver. These are folks who pay attention to promotion announcement emails, titles on LinkedIn, and who might be the manager‚Äôs ‚Äúsuccessor‚Äù. Status being a chief motivator isn‚Äôt necessarily a bad thing; I just find that managing such folks requires reminding them of the all the ways they are treated as ‚Äúspecial‚Äù.

[2] Certainty

For folks that value Certainty, it‚Äôs all about creating a calm and controlled work cadence. They love the rhythm of annual planning, quarterly goals, predictable releases, and the biweekly demo hour. They don‚Äôt love escalations, randomization, or chaos. Irrespective of the broader environment, coaching such a person requires a manager to create a sense of order and predictability.

[3] Autonomy

People that value Autonomy want to feel like they are not only accountable for outcomes, but also have the latitude to drive things their way. Feeling micro-managed, or even a tad too much oversight, can send such an employee spiraling. Building trust and having clear communication is a must when managing someone whose focus is Autonomy.

[4] Relatedness

For the cohort that is motivated by Relatedness, their tribe is very important. They identify with the group of people they work with day in and day out, and anything that messes with that can throw them off. For example, this is the type of person that leaves a job because multiple folks they were close with also departed. When making org changes, these are the people to think about with regards to 2nd order impact. As a team leader, the best thing to do with employees that value Relatedness is to build multiple levels of strong bonds that they can lean on.

[5] Fairness

For the Fairness crowd, it‚Äôs paramount that the rules of the team / organization / company be transparently communicated and evenly applied. Any hint of favorable treatment is a no-no. Over-communicating not only decisions but also the ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù behind them goes a long way with this group. And in situations where exceptions need to be made, painting them as such vs happenstance is key.

I‚Äôd love to hear from readers on the approaches they‚Äôve taken to coach folks across the motivation spectrum - please chime in via commentsüëá. And if you enjoyed this post, please consider

Self-Fulfilling Story-Telling & PM Protagonists,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/self-fulfilling-story-telling-and,"If you listen to people, you‚Äôll find that there are patterns in the way they talk about themselves, and you‚Äôve got to be very careful about how you tell these stories, because it starts to become you; you are, in the way you craft your narrative, kind of crafting your character.

Michael Lewis

I wrote

last week

about public speaking, which is just one dimension of how ideas are communicated. I consider communication to be a must-have skill in the PMs I hire, and one (very powerful) communication device at a PM‚Äôs disposal is story-telling. Any product you can think of has stories behind it - the

origin story

, the

release story

, etc. And a good PM has to understand that they serve as the protagonist (whether they want to or not) of the story in the eyes of the audience (stakeholders, customers, etc).

There are a bunch of anti-patterns around ineffective storytelling and ways in which PMs can leave potential unfulfilled, opportunity uncapitalized, and markets untapped. But those are obvious in hindsight with any failed product, so I‚Äôd rather talk about the paradigms of story-telling a PM can use to position their products and teams for success.

the reluctant leader

- this is the PM that has the mantle of leadership thrust upon them, willing to feel exec wrath in order to shield their eng / design team

the neutral spokesperson

- this is the PM that has connected the cross-functional dots and uses that to speak with credibility and cohesion

the voice of the user

- this PM can‚Äôt be argued with, because they are customer obsessed and armed with pithy anecdotes, timeless data, and the rare ‚Äúanec-data‚Äù

the market maker

- this PM has such an instinct for market trends, competitor analysis, and black swans that they overwhelm you with the cost of inaction

the righteous crusader

- this is the PM that picks a cause (broken window, performance improvement) that rallies an otherwise un-aligned organization

the grizzled veteran

- this is the PM that can do hand-to-hand combat with all potential antagonists and just keep chipping away to make incremental progress

the uber-planner

- this is the PM that has thought through every dimension of every problem and is worth betting on just based on planning rigor / execution prowess

These archetypes are common enough that the powers that be (executives, investors, etc) recognize them implicitly, and are willing to take bets on a product based on that pattern matching.

So as a PM, keep in mind that:

you serve as the protagonist of your product‚Äôs story

clearly communicating that story can be make or break

leveraging a known storytelling device optimizes delivery

Would love to hear from readers on other techniques used to convey product stories‚Ä¶

Shiny Disco Balls,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/shiny-disco-balls,"Readers of this newsletter know by now that I tend to end up in strange situations, with no one to blame but myself and my own idiosyncrasies.

About 15 years ago, I bought a 1st generation iPod Shuffle. Given that my preferred way of consuming music at the time (and still today) was just endless playlists, I thought it would be the perfect device for me. After unboxing the product, I plugged it into my PC running Windows XP‚Ä¶and realized I needed iTunes to actually move music from my laptop to the iPod. And this is where I made things unnecessarily difficult for myself; I refused to install / use iTunes (it was super clunky on Windows). Also, I thought it was a terrible (and ill-communicated) portion of the experience (to have to install desktop software to get a mobile device to function). In my mind, I should have been able to just plug the device into the USB port and drag and drop music files over. But you couldn‚Äôt.

Eventually, I found a hack whereby using WinAmp (which I loved) sort of worked. Sort of. It would occasionally bork the device and you‚Äôd be stuck with the iPod endlessly playing one song on infinite loop. This is the state my device ultimately ended up in, and for years I had a single song to remind me of my attempt to mess with the Apple walled garden.

I know what you‚Äôre thinking‚Ä¶what was the song?

But the moral of the story is not to keep your strange musical tastes to yourself.

Whether you refer to it as Out of the Box Experience (OOBE), New User Experience (NUX), or First Time User Experience (FTUX), you can bet motivated users will do the strangest things during setup because they have an intuitive sense for how they‚Äôd like your product to work.

Skip Step SaaS,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/skip-step-saas,"Spending as much time as I do studying / building SaaS products, you tend to see patterns emerge. I‚Äôm going to share one today for how to bootstrap a 0 -> 1 SaaS offering in 3 steps.

(Yes, I know the diagram looks like a barn - I struggled with how to visualize it.)

My basic thesis here is that many (all?) SaaS products are fundamentally about re-imagining a workflow that is sub-optimal for some reason; if you can figure how to simplify the creation flow for the core user, and create a consumption bridge for adjacent users, you have a product powered by an insight that lets you skip steps. Bear with me as a I try to make ‚Äúskip step SaaS‚Äù a thing.

When you‚Äôre looking to identify a multi-* process, you can take the tactic of exploring workflows that are multi-step, multi-tool, multi-user, or multi-phase. The aha! you bring to the problem is to have a unique point of view on how / why multi-* can be collapsed into a single-* (a single step, a single tool, a single user, a single phase). How would you even go about sussing out such opportunities? Just observe users in their work environments - look for the inefficiencies in the workflow or the toolchain that distract from their actual job to be done. In other words,

watch the bartender

.

The opportunity you identified in the first step will dictate how you simplify the end-to-end flow in your subsequent step; a multi-step process is simplified by making it single-step, a multi-user flow is simplified by creating a shared space, a manual input/output is simplified through automation, etc. How do you know what dimension is worth simplifying? This is where your point of view comes in again - you have a hypothesis that by leveraging a better solution for a piece of the workflow, you are going to reduce the effort on the part of the user by 10x. Users in a particular domain are always evolving - either core users are up-leveling their sophistication or new users with nascent aptitude are emerging - and you need to create new levels of abstraction to meet these users where they are.

The last step in bootstrapping a SaaS product is bridging the collaboration divide between core and adjacent users. Work actually happens across teams, across departments, across organizations‚Ä¶but because the hierarchical org chart is our default view of the user population, we tend to miss this nuance. So how do you find these seams in the collaboration experience that you can superglue with your service? This is only half-joking - look at the use cases for spreadsheets. If folks are exporting a CSV list from one app and bringing it to another app (or worse manually munging data), that‚Äôs an opportunity for a latent collaboration flow that can onboard an entirely new user cohort.

One additional thought on this skip-step-SaaS playbook that I‚Äôll explore in future posts is the creator/consumer interplay. The more valuable part of a SaaS product, over time, is usually either the creation flow or the consumption flow - it tends to follow an 80/20 split - but how do you actually know early on which will be your differentiator?

Note: this is usually the point in my articles where I leave the reader to ponder‚Ä¶but today I actually wanted to share my own thinking. I pressure tested this recipe against some SaaS solutions that I‚Äôve used and tried to articulate how they addressed each step.

I‚Äôd love to hear from readers on whether they agree / disagree with this framing, and potentially learn about SaaS products that break the mold -  please chime in via commentsüëá. And if you enjoyed this post, please  consider

South Star Metrics,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/south-star-metrics,"Misused metrics have resulted in some of the worst UX decisions ever.

We‚Äôve all heard the term ‚Äúnorth star metric‚Äù, which is the over-arching needle that a product team is supposed to move (because it ties directly to business objectives and/or customer value). But sometimes, over-rotating on a number results in an anti-pattern with unintended side effects - I refer to this scenario as a ‚Äúsouth star metric‚Äù.

Let me walk you through an example.

During my Amazon tenure, I spent a lot of time on hiring - at my peak I was doing 5 phone screens and 1 onsite a week‚Ä¶

for a solid year

(topic for a future post). You get to a point where you have canned questions and all the answers start to sound the same (not in a bad way - many candidates just know how to give a good-but-not-contentious answer given the interview-prep industry). One of my pet questions:

‚Äúwalk me through a time when you had a decision to make, and the data in your hands didn‚Äôt match the intuition in your head - how did you reconcile?‚Äù

My rationale for asking this question:

get a baseline for whether the candidate is

data- driven / informed / aware

get a sense for whether the candidate has

honed product intuition

get a flavor for any

decision-making frameworks

the candidate uses

get an idea of how the candidate

communicates with stakeholders

Getting back to the story‚Ä¶one of the most amazing responses to this question came from a Microsoft PM. The candidate had been on the Windows Update team, and their goal was to increase the % of Windows machines that were on the latest version of the OS. The # had historically hovered around 80% no matter what the team did, and there was a strong desire to get the number over 90% (the theory being that machines on the latest software were less susceptible to security exploits, less likely to report bugs, etc). The prevailing approach for a long time had been to prompt the user to install (either right away or at a scheduled time) the pending update - but a pesky 20% just wouldn‚Äôt. So‚Ä¶

‚Äúwe decided to just stop asking users!‚Äù

I nearly fell out of my chair. I had in front of me one of the masterminds of the most-annoying, feature-not-a-bug, productivity issues in corporate life - the dreaded reboot while you‚Äôre in the middle of typing. When I prompted the candidate to explain how the team reconciled the experience trade-off, the response was ‚Äúwell, the metric‚Äù.

South. Star. Metric.

This is just one instance of metrics misuse to the point of counter-productivity. Some other scenarios I‚Äôve seen:

business metrics negatively affecting customer experience (e.g. ad load goes up, CSAT goes down)

product team demoralized from inability to impact GTM metrics (e.g. revenue is a function of demand pipeline / sales execution and not just product value)

boosting one part of a chain of metrics without thinking end-to-end (e.g. running a campaign for signups, but nothing corresponding to lift conversion)

the metric is so urgent that the team is dinged for spending cycles on work that doesn‚Äôt move the needle (e.g. exploratory workstreams that pay off down the road)

metrics that are inconsequential when viewed through a broader lens (e.g. optimizing perf of technology

X

while all new development happens on

Y

)

metrics that are nonsensical because they destroy the business (e.g. reducing the # of production incidents / rollbacks by moratorium-ing number of deploys to ~0)

metrics for 2 different products that are incongruent (e.g. time on site is at odds with search results quality, yet many sites try to optimize both at the same time)

These are all topics for future exploration, and they all have a war story (of course) behind them. By the way, none of this is meant to imply that data-driven product development is suspect, but it‚Äôs critical when setting north star metrics that they:

exist for a long enough time horizon

connect  business <-> customer value

account for the end-to-end journey

Span (vs Split) Personas,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/span-vs-split-personas,"Sometimes an idea will defy articulation until all the dots connects. And sometimes dots just connect when many more articulate people share their ideas. A few enterprise SaaS concepts I‚Äôve been playing around with in my posts over the past few months recently came together:

your primary / target persona works within a larger, cross-functional process (hence you need to identify and activate latent adjacent users)

work happens collaboratively (vs individually), and the team is now the primary persona to build for (which is why you must default to multi player)

enterprise spend is focused on products that boost the efficiency and effectiveness of teams (i.e. productivity is the ultimate ROI)

Of course, there are no new ideas. Peter Drucker essentially spelled this out 50 years ago:

‚ÄúThere are no marketing problems, there are no finance problems, there are no accounting problems, there are only business problems.‚Äù

The gist here is an enterprise software solution (i.e. your product) needs to enable a horizontal pod with a job to be done vs a vertical persona that‚Äôs a step in the flow. Focus on design, not just designers. Focus on development, not just developers. Focus on research, not just researchers. Focus on sales, not just sellers. There are companies and products popping up around each these jobs to be done, and

Products are workflows. It‚Äôs obvious once you see it. But the challenge (no one said PM-ing was easy) is getting your average enterprise customer to see this point of view. Some specific hurdles I‚Äôve written about before:

enterprises measuring (or even caring about) team-level productivity

team-level productivity actually correlating to business outcomes

team definitions maturing from hierarchy-based to pod-based

Again, there is nothing as succinct as a Tweet to drive the point home.

Staying Synced on Strategy,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/staying-synced-on-strategy,"I‚Äôve recently been getting some great topic ideas from reader comments - a question from earlier this week that got me thinking:

‚ÄúAre there systematic practices to prevent disoriented teams in the first place?‚Äù

You can see the original thread on the

Disoriented Teams

post

here

.

Strategy (overused word, I know) is the glue that keeps teams oriented - so any systemic practices designed to prevent organizational drift have to lean on strategy as the foundation. But what makes one strategy better or worse than another in terms of keeping oriented? The answer is coherence. What I mean by coherence is that the strategy clicks for an organization, like all the puzzle pieces coming together; conversely, an incoherent strategy has one or more aspects due to which it doesn‚Äôt quite fit.

There are 4 dimensions of coherence:

legibility

synchronicity

composability

affordability

Legibility

When a strategy is legible, it‚Äôs easy for folks to digest. It‚Äôs clearly written, well synthesized, chunked into digestible pieces, and ideally summarized into a compelling visual or tagline. We‚Äôve all seen and read and heard strategies that overly rely on buzz words and rambling explanations - legibility means short and sweet. And when a strategy is legible, it enables and empowers teams to make decisions and trade-offs at a local level vs escalating things up the chain.

Synchroncity

A strategy is synchronous when the organizational design aligns with it; in other words, a strategy has to navigate the hierarchy of a company. Of course communication is critical and repetition is necessary, but if the hierarchy implicitly re-broadcasts the strategy, you get maximum distribution and alignment. There are many mechanisms to share and drive accountability (OKRs, DRIs, etc), but at the end of the day if a strategy is creating friction by going against cultural norms, communication channels, and standard practices, it‚Äôll be hard to execute. What this also means is that sometimes a re-org is required to run with a strategy; given how expensive org changes are, you‚Äôll need a legible strategy for folks to buy in.

Composability

Executing a strategy can be a delicate dance - composability means the sequencing is correct. There‚Äôs a logical ordering to a well laid plan, and not every workstream needs to be kicked off in parallel in a mad dash to the finish line. The science behind a well composed strategy consists of proper scoping, accurate sizing, reasonable staffing, and dependency management. The less composable a strategy is, the more dragged down it is by coordination overhead.

Affordability

Affordability is an idea you might not have thought of that comes into play often. Just because a strategy is legible, the org is aligned, and the plan is logical doesn‚Äôt mean the org has the stomach to actually do it. Strategic execution requires (sometimes very hard) trade-offs and you have to say no (or no more) to many things in the interest of saying yes to the main thing. The willingness to make someone (employees, partners, customers) unhappy in the short term for a payoff in the long term is affordability - not every company is willing to pay the price.

In summary, if all these factors come together properly, you have a coherent strategy.

legibility ‚Üí written clearly

synchronicity ‚Üí broadcasted regularly

composability ‚Üí planned logically

affordability ‚Üí executed effortlessly

And when one (or all) of these areas don‚Äôt click, incoherence, and ultimately disoriented teams, are the end result.

Strategy Spirals,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/strategy-spirals,"As readers know, I write from time to time about why product teams spiral into strategic misalignment or get fixated on metrics over outcomes, but I think I‚Äôve been missing one angle on why it‚Äôs so hard to change once you set a course: emotions.

Listening to a podcast recently with a leadership coach, it dawned on me that so much ‚Äúdigging in‚Äù around strategy and metrics from execs and teams comes down to the inability to let go of a narrative they had constructed on when, how, and to what degree they would be successful.

‚ÄúI work with a lot of teams on grief - startups have this idea that they will have X users or Y revenue by a certain amount of time, and it‚Äôs a grieving process to let that go‚Äù

Multiple times in my career I‚Äôve had to execute a shift, either at the top-level strategy, or around the tactical KPIs being tracked, and there‚Äôs always a change management cost that I‚Äôd attributed to communication / coordination tax, but the reality is there is grief in letting go of a particular path you‚Äôd envisoned for your product, and as change agents we have to be cognizant of and empathetic to that.

Survey - B2B PM Personas,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/survey-b2b-pm-personas,"if you work on B2B products, you‚Äôve probably noticed a tension between the ‚Äúinbound‚Äù parts of the job like working with design/engineering/research to build the product and the ‚Äúoutbound‚Äù aspects of the job like working with marketing/sales/success to bring the product to market

my understanding is some companies even separate the PM ladder along inbound / outbound tracks - which is something I‚Äôve found awkward and artificially constraining for a PM who just wants to GSD (remember, I prefer

PM tweeners to purists

)

BUT

I‚Äôve recently noticed (maybe because I am working more on 0‚Üí1 products) that some PMs are great with

users

(understand the problem, solve the pain, create delightful experiences) while other PMs excel at navigating

buyers

(ask great discovery questions, circle the compelling event, tease out commercial constraints)

and I‚Äôm starting to wonder‚Ä¶are there

user PMs

vs

buyer PMs

in B2B products? should those be 2 different roles? is it fair to ask 1 PM to excel at both for a new product line?

Synthesizing Learnings,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/synthesizing-learnings,"One of my favorite questions to ask myself after an interview is ‚Äú

did I learn something from this person?

‚Äù. Most good hires, in my experience, are able to bring learning rituals to the table and up-level you and your team‚Äôs knowledge practices. This was my experience with a recent PM interview my team did. The candidate had a simple but effective template for synthesizing learnings from user research / customer interviews.

Many product teams do research, but don‚Äôt take the critical steps of synthesizing and disseminating learnings. They either fail to convert information into knowledge, or that knowledge stays trapped within the pod and doesn‚Äôt help educate the broader product / engineering / design org.

And that‚Äôs why this template really resonated with me - it was a low-effort / high-leverage way to summarize research, synthesize learning, and prep action.

I created an example snapshot for a product team that‚Äôs building a new note-taking app.

As you can see, this approach offers several benefits:

you capture key quotes (vs people having to listen to / watch entire calls)

you blend qualitative (quotes) and quantitative (data) insights

you up-level what you‚Äôre seeing / hearing into learnings, which is the altitude a product team should operate and debate at (i.e. agree or disagree on whether you‚Äôre learning what you think you‚Äôre learning vs arguing about numbers)

you wrap with an actionable next step - the biggest gift a product team can give their users is thoughtfully acting on their feedback

Teaching Users Your Product...,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/teaching-users-your-product,"I‚Äôve been thinking a lot recently about the purpose of a product and how to successfully fulfill it. When writing last year about ‚Äúproduct market flex‚Äù (which is fluid) vs ‚Äúproduct market fit‚Äù (which is static), I noted that there is sometimes a mismatch between your product‚Äôs capabilities and the maturity of the market.

So what do you do if you end up in this mismatch of capabilities and maturity?

Well, this is the heart of ‚Äúproduct work‚Äù (which is done not only by PMs but Design, Engineering, GTM, etc).

There are 2 strategic levers a product team has when this mismatch arises:

Reduce the effort required by the user to get value

Increase the literacy level of your target user base

Basically, you have to make your solution easier to use to meet your user where they are

OR

your pipeline of prospective users has to arrive at your product with a higher literacy level. And you can think of that latter bucket as ‚Äúteaching users your product‚Äù.

In the past, I‚Äôve broken down the user‚Äôs product journey into 3 simple phases:

not activated (zero usage of your product)

activated (superficial usage of your product)

sophisticated (high-value usage of your product)

You obviously want as much of your user base to be Bucket 3, because Buckets 1 and 2 are future churn, albeit different flavors. Bucket 1 is failure to deploy, while Bucket 2 is failure to ROI.

So ‚Äúteaching users your product‚Äù is a critical churn-prevention tactic. But in a recent conversation with a group of CPOs, I realized that I was treating ‚Äúteaching users your product‚Äù as 1 big job, and in reality there are potentially 3 sub-jobs hiding behind it. When you teach your product, you actually teach 3 different dimensions:

the interface

- the components, objects, and patterns that make up your product‚Äôs vocabulary, allowing user‚Äôs to navigate and explore on their own and upskill themselves over time

the domain

- the language of the field in which your user‚Äôs operate, keeping in mind that some people will need only basic phrases to survive while others need to be fluent to accomplish their goals

the benefit

- the actual ROI user‚Äôs get from using your product vs a competitor‚Äôs product or their legacy in-house solution or a manual hack; when you‚Äôre teaching folks a new way to do the same job, you have to sell them on the change being worth it

And when you think about these sub-jobs in the context of the entire product surface, you realize that for your product, in your market, for your users, teaching certain dimensions is easier / harder via certain surface areas. The usual universe of product surface can include the following:

user interface

documentation

professional services

partner ecosystem

champion community

templates and tutorials

I‚Äôm still mulling over how to apply this framework in my day-to-day, but some early thoughts that I‚Äôve been considering:

it‚Äôs really hard to invent and establish a new interface, so user‚Äôs will likely want your interface to conform to all the other tools they‚Äôre familiar with (this is known as Jakob‚Äôs Law)

you need to know the domain knowledge aptitude of every user that enters your product, which is another way of saying a one-size-fits-all onboarding journey doesn‚Äôt work unless it‚Äôs a well established domain

if people understand the domain but your interface lets them down, they will fall back to tools they know (i.e. everything ends up in Excel)

if the benefit is disconnected from the user‚Äôs problems, then you will struggle to get adoption (i.e. IT department pushing security / compliance tools that users hate using but are forced to go along with)

Team Brand vs Identity,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/team-brand-vs-identity,"This is not a post about how brand and identity are the same thing, just from different viewpoints.This is not a post about how one derives from the other. This is not a post about how they are both equally important. This is not a post encouraging you to focus on both as they serve different purposes.

Yes, they are 2 sides of the same coin. Yes, they feed into and reinforce each other. Yes, they both matter. Yes, they both need your attention.

But this is not that post.

This is a post about how, during times of change and periods of scale, one is multiple orders of magnitude more critical than the other. This is a post about identity being 99% of the equation, and brand coming in 2nd, at a measly 1%.

This is a post about your team's identity being the key to navigating change, overcoming uncertainty, and flourishing amidst chaos.

Taking a step back, it helps to define the 2 terms (in a corporate context):

Identity: your team's own perception of how and where it fits

Brand: the external perception of how and where your team fits

But it's all about branding these days, right?

Sort of.

It's all about self-branding, which makes sense for you as an individual. But you can't stretch self-branding across teammates. There's no shared connective tissue there, which is what identity provides.

As for the outward perception (i.e. brand) of your team, it's hard to unify - it's very much in the eye of the beholder, whether that be your customers or stakeholders or partners. It's hard to put all those external opinions together cohesively, which is why having a strong internal ethos (i.e. identity) is critical.

In many ways, this is a post that only makes sense if you've been there, done that; if you've had to forge an identity in order to have an impact as a group. A strong team identity is the result of tribal knowledge, shared context, and collective delivery; it takes time, effort, and focus. But once you have it, it becomes very difficult for anyone to make a dent in it, whether it's team newcomers or outside parties.

Particularly during chaotic times, your team can rely on a strong, shared identity to manage through turmoil. Specifically, identity gives you the following advantages that brand doesn't:

pattern matching situations (based on past experiences) to frame decisions effectively

a mutually-agreed-upon decision-making framework (based on established norms) to execute efficiently

a communication model that encompasses both breadth and depth and eliminates repetition, confusion, and clarification

So. If you're starting a new team, spend some upfront time thinking about how the identity you establish can set the group up for success. If you're taking over an existing team, suss out their identity to ensure you approach things the right way. If you're managing a team through a transition, make sure you understand the flexibility of their identity.

In short, the badge you give yourselves is way more important and enduring than the labels others may throw at you.

The 3 S's of the Product Lifecycle,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/the-3-ss-of-the-product-lifecycle,"A few years ago, I was in a rut learning-wise, feeling like I was going through the motions and keeping a bunch of product trains running on time, without actually moving the needle (because the needle was in a haystack). After the requisite amount of self-pity, I sought out one of my mentors and had a candid conversation.

I explained to my advisor that everything I was working on was on auto-pilot, and the exponential learning (i.e. drinking from a firehose sensation) that I had enjoyed in the role for so long was in the rearview mirror. His advice was really simple:

‚ÄúChange your environment to match your preferred learning mode, or find a new role.‚Äù

There are essentially 3 distinct phases of a product‚Äôs lifecycle he said, and therefore 3 types of roles for a PM to tackle:

Starter

Scaler

Sustainer

Let‚Äôs dig into each one.

[1] Starter

A starter is on point to build a v1 product based on business opportunity / market need / customer problem. But what that will exactly look like is ever-shifting, and there is likely plenty of trial and error trying to pinpoint target personas. Bootstrapping (technology, solutions, users) is a recurring theme, and the focus is on navigating the journey to product-market fit.

[2] Scaler

A scaler takes a product with a clear use case to completeness. This means articulating the ideal user journey, removing any friction points, and identifying adjacent opportunities to expand into. This involves partnering with other functions (analytics, marketing, sales, support) to establish mechanisms such that the bootstrapping done by the starter can happen with less super-human efforts / serendipity. The outputs of this phase are lightweight frameworks and repeatable playbooks.

[3] Sustainer

A sustainer loves zeroing in on systemic issues that prevent a business from humming. The key operating principles for sustainers are process, optimization, and process optimization. They evolve products to a point where multiple use cases can be supported and experimentation can happen at scale. Ultimately, they get things to a juncture where the organization can get back to start mode, completely a virtuous cycle.

[4] Sunsetter

Surprise! It‚Äôs easier to remember things in 3‚Äôs, but there is a 4th mode that a starter, scaler, or sustainer can end up in: sunsetting. It‚Äôs quite possible (and you should always keep this in mind going in) that a product doesn‚Äôt find a real fit, doesn‚Äôt achieve true scale, and doesn‚Äôt become the standard. In that scenario, it‚Äôs logical to re-assess a product investment and end-of-life-ing is a step every PM has to navigate.

Going back to my conversation with my mentor, it made me realize a 3 things:

you should introspect on your preferred learning mode

your preference can change over the course of your career

when you run a portfolio of products, you can have all 3

So how do you like to operate?

The 7 Signs of GIGO Strategy,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/the-7-signs-of-gigo-strategy,"It‚Äôs that time of year for many folks: annual planning cycle. For that reason alone, I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about strategy. I also recorded a podcast recently (coming early Dec) where we tried to reverse engineer a product‚Äôs strategy from the public messaging around it. In that context, I‚Äôve also been pondering why sometimes good intentions lead to bad strategies, and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd like to explore today.

GIGO. Garbage In, Garbage Out.

Not an original take by me - I got it from Hiten Shah via Nathan Baschez (link below). His basic thesis is folks spend too much time on strategy frameworks and not enough time on strategy inputs. But what are the other reasons people fall into the GIGO trip when working on  strategy?

Framework Focus

- I agree with Hiten‚Äôs point about higher quality input producing higher quality strategy. But folks tend to over-index on the framework for the how the strategy will be articulated. As knowledge workers, I think we sometimes focus on the format because it‚Äôs less imposing; you‚Äôre not starting with a blank slate. It‚Äôs same reason we fiddle with the PowerPoint template instead of working on our talk track. But if the best thing about your strategy is how comprehensive the structure is (objective, principles, hurdles, metrics) then you have a problem. Where the framework does matter is communication; how does your audience absorb ideas and how does your company disseminate tactics?

Date Driven

- This might be the planning cycle scars talking, but letting dates dictate things is silly (with strong shades of prioritizing output over outcomes). [Aside: every place I‚Äôve ever worked folks about complained about annual planning, quarterly planning, financial planning, etc]. While (artificially urgent) dates can be the culprit, more than likely the deadline dread is really just masking a larger issue, which I‚Äôll cover next‚Ä¶

Lack of Learning

- Many product teams are hyper focused on volume and velocity of shipping and not stopping to think about what impact they‚Äôre having or what they‚Äôre learning. And I‚Äôm not referring to some nebulous learning - a product team that has learning rigor is actually actively, regularly better understanding target personas, competitive landscape, market adjacencies, user behavior, technology trends, etc. If a team has that handy, they have high quality inputs to feed into a strategy revamp, and no date pressure can affect that. Strategy is all about leveraging your learnings, which is hard to do if you have none.

Constrained Mindset

- This is one I‚Äôve actually been guilty of. So much of product success (or just survival) is learning to operate within constraints. But if you let that carry over to your strategy creation, you artificially reduce your optionality. If you over-index on how many developers are on the team or how hard it is to hire or how budget is tight or what your competition just announced or how the analysts scored your product, you paint yourself into a corner and limit your own potential. Good strategy leads to re-alignment, divestments, trade-offs, (hard) choices - you have to craft something that forces those conversations (vs assuming they‚Äôre not viable paths).

Functional Bias

- It‚Äôs sad, but at a lot of companies the strategy is ‚Äúthe PM‚Äôs job‚Äù. The reality is a well-rounded team / pod / squad takes full advantage of the expertise of it‚Äôs various cross-functional members. It‚Äôs blasphemy, I know, but I‚Äôll say it: PMs aren‚Äôt great at everything. Designers can interpret user behavior better. Analysts can interpret data better. Marketers can validate positioning better. Engineers can architect systems better. And the best PMs can stitch it all together, better than anyone. But PMs going into a room to ‚Äúhash out strategy‚Äù is definitely an anti-pattern.

Seniority Bias

- The only thing more dangerous than PMs deciding strategy in a functional silo is execs doing so in an echo chamber. When you are too far removed (from data, from customers, from technology, from usage) you over-compensate with pattern matching. But in a world with shifting markets / trends / behavior, pattern matching can let you down or lead you astray. In my view, execs are best suited to investment decisions, empowering teams, setting context, pressure testing, aligning orgs - but making choices in a product domain (which is the heart of strategy creation) is best left to those closest to the problem space.

South Star Metrics

- I‚Äôve written at length about this concept before, but when you don‚Äôt have a clear / correct north star metric, you‚Äôre basically running place (or perhaps backwards). The only thing more dangerous than focusing on output over outcomes is potentially going after the wrong outcomes. So much of strategy  comes down trade-offs and tactics for how to move the needle as quickly and as completely as possible on the metric you‚Äôve chosen; if you choose the wrong metric, you end up with quality input mis-directed (and still ultimately GIGO).

I‚Äôd love to hear from readers on how they fell into and climbed out of the GIGO pit - please chime in via commentsüëá. And if you enjoyed this post, please consider

The Agent Development Life Cycle,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/the-agent-development-life-cycle,"Note: I have 2 upcoming interviews as part of

discussing

Building Zero-to-One Products in Established Companies

and

Sangeet Paul Choudary

talking about

Generative AI in Platform Ecosystems

. Both events are free, live, virtual webinars‚Ä¶but seats are limited so sign up today!

One side benefit of these video interviews I‚Äôve been doing is they give me a reason to call up former colleagues and old friends to talk shop. And in today‚Äôs episode, I share a recap of my conversation with my old Twitter buddy

Arya Asemanfar

. It‚Äôs not an exaggeration to say Arya was the tip of the engineering spear in the rearchitecture of Twitter‚Äôs platform services stack in the early 2010s; without his efforts, the

Fail Whale would still be a thing

. In short, he knows what he‚Äôs talking about, and when he‚Äôs hyped about something, it‚Äôs wise to listen. So my ears definitely perked up when he told me that

agent development

was the ‚Äúnext paradigm shift in software development‚Äù.

What are agents? And how does the build/test/deploy workflow differ from the traditional software development lifecycle (SDLC)?

Well, you can read more on that

here

and

here

in a couple of blog posts from Sierra (where Arya leads Product Engineering). But the reason this is a new frontier becomes clear when you hear him talk about how the traditional techniques and tools don‚Äôt translate over when dealing with a conversational paradigm vs a traditional web or mobile UI.

And with this new development scheme, there is also a new role emerging: agent engineer (which again the Sierra folks elaborate on

here

). This role is tasked with productionizing the power of LLMs in combination with orchestration logic such that businesses can replace workflows with agents. Arya and I talk through several customer support examples, since that is an obvious application of this capability (listeners and readers will recall

my conversation with Anurag Wadehra

from

where he talked AI being a boon to these types of workflows).

In this next clip, Arya uses the transition from Photoshop to Figma as an analogy for how new agent design tools need to provide abstractions and primitives that allow agent engineers to be more expressive and design richer applications more quickly.

In fact, we‚Äôre so early in this journey that we have yet to publicly name these new patterns and interfaces. Arya makes a really interesting point about some of the most successful tech companies of the last 20 years not only building compelling products, but also creating the blueprint for how web, mobile, and services development happens; that‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs happening with agent development right now.

We of course get into whether agents backed by LLMs are replacement or augmentation for today‚Äôs knowledge workers. The current consensus looks to be this will be a net improvement to the customer experience while also creating higher-leverage work for employees of business.

Another angle we delve into is the ability of agents to provide a more consistent experience as opposed to humans, who are more susceptible to variance in decisioning logic. It turns out predictability makes best practices (like experimentation) easier to introduce and business goals (like optimization) simpler to accomplish.

I‚Äôm including this next clip because in it Arya acknowledges that I asked a really ‚Äúastute‚Äù question (it happens on occasion!). Basically, the rationale of an agent needs to be inspected from time to time in order to train and tune the system‚Ä¶but also so that humans can learn from it. Which in turn has led to the awareness that there is ‚Äúan iceberg of necessary tools and products and experiences to effectively run an agent‚Äù.

We cover a wide variety of topics around agent development in the remainder of the conversation:

The Anti- Moonshot Factory,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/the-anti-moonshot-factory,"short post today on something that really spoke to me‚Ä¶

Over the years, I‚Äôve worked with many product teams (and leaders) that are obsessed with the idea of a ‚Äúmoonshot‚Äù - they are basically betting the farm on a 10x feature. There are of course 10x innovations all the time, and many a company and career has been made off these. But the idea that you can systematically churn out 10x moonshots, or even pull 1 off without a track record of doing so, just doesn‚Äôt compute for me. Not that I‚Äôve sat down and surveyed the biggest product innovators, but my read on such breakthroughs is that they were always preceded by tons of ‚Äúfailures‚Äù and moments of learning that were not obvious in the moment.

One of my favorite exchanges around product innovation and how much the consumer will simplify the process to comprehend it is this question someone posed to Charles Eames:

""Charles was once asked, 'Did you think of the Eames chair in a flash?' He replied, 'Yes, sort of a 30-year flash.""

The reason I resonate so strongly with this quote is that I‚Äôm a firm believer in 1% better, every day. It all adds up and pays off somehow / someday down the road. As long as you‚Äôre confident you‚Äôre going in the right direction, intellectual rigor, solid decisions, and a learning mindset will get you where you need to go; if a step-function jump happens along the way, it‚Äôs more good habits compounding vs moonshot manifesting.

The Attribution Graph,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/the-attribution-graph,"One of the more interesting markets for PMs to operate in is products that help product teams. In my view, cross-functional product teams are becoming a recurring entity within the enterprise that‚Äôs more reasonable to build for than an individual function. You can think of most collaboration and productivity software as having a targeted use case for product teams, and one way I like to visualize enabling such a team is lighting up a network, specifically activating certain nodes in the network that are critical path; I‚Äôve started referring to the turned on nodes in this enterprise network the ‚Äúattribution graph‚Äù.

If you‚Äôre building and selling enterprise products, you‚Äôve historically thought on at least 2 levels:

the account / company / enterprise (with centralized IT budgets)

the end user / knowledge worker (with a productivity job to be done)

If you have some sophistication (or a vertical approach), you may introduce the idea of department-level products, since there is growing budget there.

But the real audience for your product is the virtual teams / non-hierarchical pods that come together to build and ship things. If the company is a network, your product‚Äôs goal is to set in motion critical paths in that network - your job is to light up the attribution graph.

Unfortunately, most companies don‚Äôt model their organizations this way or publish their corporate directories as such. But with SaaS, unlike the days of shrink-wrap software, you now actually have robust tools and learning mechanisms to suss out the full attribution graph in play.

I‚Äôd love to hear from readers about their attempts to identify and target attribution graphs via their products - please chime in via commentsüëá. And if you enjoyed this post, please consider

The Business Model Makes (or Breaks) the Business,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/the-business-model-makes-or-breaks,"It‚Äôs interesting how the choice of business model, or even the mindset around what type of business you are, ends up becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy.

I wonder if there has ever been a more dramatic example than Twitter of this dissonance where the choice of business / model leads to a drastically different outcome than what was otherwise possible.

There‚Äôs been lots of chatter recently about Twitter adding a paid subscription, and a lot of the negative reactions make sense from a consumer perspective - consumers who view Twitter as a media company don‚Äôt like the idea of switching from an ads based model to a subscription model. It‚Äôs like if your local newspaper suddenly said they were going to gate premium content ala the NY Times - what a bait and switch?!?

A subscription service is not the issue; it‚Äôs who the subscriber base is. Twitter (or it‚Äôs new overlords) want consumers to pay. When I first heard the news, I hoped it was meant for creators.

The entire issue here is that Twitter set itself up as a media business, and now we‚Äôre debating what monetization method is better for a media business. By the way, what kind of media business doesn‚Äôt create its own content or own the rights to the content produced on its platform?

‚ÄúWhen you publish your thoughts on Twitter, you are doing labor for that company. Yes, you get followers, but you can‚Äôt take them with you. They can‚Äôt pay to support you, either. You‚Äôre the product, not the customer. Twitter needs your mind so it can satisfy its real customers: advertisers.‚Äù

What if Twitter had set itself up as as creator business and made the consumer user base secondary? What if the real users were the 1% creators (journalists, entertainers, thinkers, writers)? We would then be talking about a completely different business / model. The idea of a subscription service wouldn‚Äôt get a reaction like ‚Äúis $8 reasonable for your daily newspaper?‚Äù - it would be ‚Äúwhat is a reasonable monthly rate for a 1% creator who can monetize the hell out of their audience?‚Äù And make no mistake, Twitter is still the best platform to build and activate your audience for a variety of creators, but it‚Äôs losing ground fast.

The list of things that Twitter could have built and stitched admin / payment tools around is very long. Think of Substack as

1 sliver

of Twitter‚Äôs potential. It really makes you think how 1 simple / early choice (‚Äúwe‚Äôre a media company and we‚Äôre making money off ads‚Äù) changed the entire trajectory of what Twitter could have been‚Ä¶

I know what I‚Äôm describing is some sort of mytical ‚Äúcreator marketplace‚Äù. Except it‚Äôs not. Google it. Every other social media platform has a ‚Äúcreator marketplace‚Äù. It‚Äôs a huge missed opportunity for Twitter that all these new formats emerged while it debated 140 characters and an edit button ad nauseum.

I would love to hear other examples of these types of choices - if there was a compilation of these case studies I would buy that book in an instant!

The Convergence of Hardware & Software PMs for Connected Devices,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/the-convergence-of-hardware-and-software,"Ever since my Kindle days a decade ago, I've been keenly aware that working on a product that combines hardware + software into a unified customer experience is some of the hardest product building you'll ever do. Whether you are a hardware PM or a software PM, having a working understanding of all the handshakes and round-trip communication is key to building a functional, performant, seamless, high-quality experience.

Working on connected devices introduces some unique challenges that really test your mettle as a PM. This includes things like being unable to update devices in the wild, trying to troubleshoot issues without logs, and needing to find product-market at multiple levels of UX. Ultimately, the hardware relies on software to unleash the magic of the device, but the software is limited by the capabilities of the hardware. And sometimes you end up in an agonizing space where you need the hardware to receive and install an upgrade to unlock latent feature, but over-the-air software updates never get to 100% of devices.

PMs who specialize in hardware vs software have different mentalities, methodologies, cultures, and constraints, but communication between them is essential for the sake of the customer experience. I‚Äôve written before about

the evolving definition of product management

, and when it comes to connected devices the need for PMs to blur boundaries and operate end-to-end is even more critical. As more types of connected devices / experiences come to market, expect more convergence between these roles.

During my time leading new product launches on the Kindle team at Amazon, we had PM orgs that operated at different levels (hardware, firmware, software, services) and it was interesting to see how they had layered definitions of done; the hardware PM was focused on production ready hardware that could be consistently produced by a factory, the firmware PM wanted a device that booted up properly and passed diagnostics, the software PM worried about the on-device code being bug free and operational, and the services PM worked on ensuring last mile experiences like content purchase and delivery functioned smoothly. And while I write about those learnings from my Amazon ternure from time to time, I think there's a shortage of compelling and useful content for ""connected device"" PMs who are looking to level up.

If this is a topic you‚Äôd like to dive deeper into, I‚Äôm co-hosting a live, free tech talk later this week with the

The Evolving Definition of Product Management,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/the-evolving-definition-of-product,"While trading emails with someone in my network (I was asking what is interesting but missing content for PM learning) I was presented with this gem:

‚ÄúI think that product management remains one of the key mysteries of building a great tech company.‚Äù

This person is a C-level exec (not bragging, just context on how this person thinks) and it was enlightening and refreshing to hear their expectations of PMs. Here is the rest of the quote:

‚ÄúGenerally I think there is an important trend going on, where a product is no longer just software. SaaS products consist of software, data, human input, APIs, integrations, etc. So the definition of ‚Äòproduct‚Äô is changing. Product managers need to see this. They need to think broadly about the product although they are in their work trying to define it narrowly.‚Äù

I love this line of thinking, because it jives with many of my biases about the craft of product management.

bias for action over talking

system ¬ª sections

end-to-end experience understanding

foundation ¬ª features

like planning for scale, quality (usability, performance, cost) can‚Äôt be a bolt on after shipping

direction ¬ª data

one-offs are exactly that, moonshots don‚Äôt happen by accident, luck is manufactured by being 1% better every day

B2B products

specifically on this blog, but the thing that got me intro writing and sharing originally was management, leadership, and coaching - you can read my greatest hits

here

(there are some satirical essays in there that I really enjoyed crafting). But leadership mindset and effective coaching are topics on which I think there is lots of quantity of content but not lots of quality. And that‚Äôs why I was really excited to have

Eric Nehrlic

h joining for a recent episode of

60 Minute Stories

.

Eric is an executive coach who helps leaders have more impact by drawing on his 25 years of experience in the tech industry. He loves to identify and challenge mindsets and habits that hold people back from their next level of leadership. Before becoming a coach, Eric spent 10 years as an engineer and product manager across several startups before joining Google, eventually leading business strategy and operations for the Google Search Ads team for six years as Chief of Staff. He published his first book in 2023,

You Have A Choice: Beyond Hard Work to Meaningful Impact

, which he wrote to share the principles and mindsets that have helped him and his clients with a wider audience.

After working with 100+ clients over nearly 7 years, Eric was able to distill his core tenets of ‚Äúleader effectiveness‚Äù for our hour-long discussion. This session also had some great (and spicy) audience Q&A! Check out the whole conversation in this video episode. Note the full video is only for paying subscribers, so if you haven‚Äôt upgraded yet, you can do so via the link below.

We started by talking about Eric‚Äôs experience in ‚Äúthe room where it happens‚Äù, and interestingly the audience was split between folks who (a) want to get in that room and (b) are already in that room but need help finding their voice.

The biggest thing Eric focuses on with his exec coaching clients is mindset shift, and in this clip he breaks down the different facets of what that means and why it‚Äôs critical to succeeding as a senior leader. A lot of people struggle with it because their identity is tied to doing vs leading. I‚Äôve pointed out this issue before in a post I called

typing vs tapping

, and at its core it‚Äôs about letting go of

your IC prime

.

You get the work done through other people. And that‚Äôs really a mindset shift. It just changes your whole sense of identity, your whole sense of value, your whole sense of what it means to work.

We also get into time management and how the most impactful leaders focus on the things only they can do instead of fixating on minutiae and stepping on the toes of people in their org. When it comes to switching your mode of operation as you start your executive career, you are potentially letting go of 10, 20, even 30 years of identity as a hands-on doer. We touch on the writing of Peter Drucker and one of my favorite books (

The Effective Executive

), to drive home the need for focused time management. Some of you may even recall my tongue-in-cheek essay

The Ineffective Executive

.

We then talk about the impetus for change - what is the catalyst for folks who come to Eric for help? Sadly, but not surprisingly, burnout is the most common reason.

The conversation then delved into some real-world issues and hot topics:

psychological safety and the lack thereof limiting true executive effectiveness

executive expectations running into cultural norms and resulting DEI implications

The Ineffective Executive,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/the-ineffective-executive,"No executives were harmed during the writing of this post‚Ä¶

Hey! I‚Äôm your executive!

I‚Äôm so excited we were able to get this group together. Making sure this team is doing what I told them to do is my #1 priority.

Why did it take so long to schedule? Well, we had to plan around my calendar. And of course, I have many other priorities.

When did I say this was my #1 priority? Let‚Äôs not lose focus. The first step to any real work is a big kickoff meeting.

You guys have already been meeting regularly without me? Not sure who authorized that‚Ä¶.no one checked with me.

I haven‚Äôt heard that before‚Ä¶.‚Äùself organizing teams‚Äù‚Ä¶sounds dangerous. Let‚Äôs not make a habit of it. Now, let‚Äôs get to the agenda.

We don‚Äôt have an agenda? Hmm, how am I going to fill 90 minutes. Well, at least we‚Äôre meeting virtually.

Oh, you guys were told to come to the office. Hmm, yeah, it‚Äôs unfortunate that I couldn‚Äôt be there in person - I have a personal commitment in 30 minutes. It is a Saturday evening after all‚Ä¶.

You want to use the time to do Q&A? Not sure how you expect me to do that without prep - you might ask me anything.

AMA. OK, let‚Äôs stop using the TLAs. I thought I was clear in my email that acronyms were banned, along with work that doesn‚Äôt move the metric.

What metric? Obviously, THE metric. REVENUE! That‚Äôs what everyone on this team should be worrying about increasing.

You‚Äôre a product team? Not sure that‚Äôs a good excuse. Build a product we can sell. That‚Äôs your goal.

You have multiple goals? How did that happen? Who started adding goals?

ME? You must have misunderstood me. Next time you don‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôm telling you to do, just come ask me!

How am I difficult to schedule? I‚Äôm here right now, aren‚Äôt I? Ask me anything‚Ä¶

Ok, if I‚Äôm understanding your question, you‚Äôre asking if it‚Äôs more important for the team to do A or B? Obviously, both have to be done. Why on earth would you try to force such a trade-off?

What do you mean you don‚Äôt have enough staff to do both? Look at how many people are in this room! It‚Äôs like 2 full teams‚Ä¶

This IS 2 full teams? Who were just re-org-ed together? And you don‚Äôt know how to reconcile your backlogs? Look, you‚Äôre over-complicating this. When you don‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôm telling you to do, don‚Äôt come ask me - ask your manager!

When did I say come ask me? I‚Äôm trying to delegate here. That‚Äôs why you have a manager‚Ä¶

You don‚Äôt have a manager? Huh. Ok, I‚Äôm going to make hiring a manager my #1 priority.

My list of priorities? Not sure why you‚Äôd need to see that. Plus, it changes daily‚Ä¶

Why does it change so frequently? Well, in order for me to explain, I‚Äôd have to provide you with a bunch of business context‚Ä¶so ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

You want to better understand the strategy? OK, it‚Äôs simple: REVENUE! Generate it.

How do we decide which revenue-generating ideas make sense for us? Whatever makes the most revenue, that‚Äôs how. It‚Äôs like basketball - 3 points is better than 2 points. Every time.

Field goal percentage? Player efficiency rating? Adjusted plus minus? You can‚Äôt get caught up in a bunch of advanced metrics. It‚Äôs not like anyone in the NBA has a dashboard tracking all that. Stop bringing up irrelevant analogies.

No, I don‚Äôt think I was the one that brought up basketball. I never use sports analogies. Now, let‚Äôs keep our eye on the ball‚Ä¶we don‚Äôt need to worry about building metrics dashboards.

We already built a metrics dashboard? Who asked you to waste time creating that?

ME? And I said it was the most important thing? Huh. Well, hopefully the team didn‚Äôt spend too much time on it.

Oh, you‚Äôve spent the entire quarter on it. And that‚Äôs why you can only do A or B, and not both, at this point?

You guys need to do a better job prioritizing. I‚Äôm going to have to have a 1:1 with your manager about this as soon as he‚Äôs hired.

What do you mean ‚Äúor she‚Äù?

Oh, yes. Yes, of course we might hire a female. Don‚Äôt let my choice of language confuse you. I don‚Äôt have any biases. I did the training!

DEI? Again with the acronyms. And I know what the last manager of the team said when she left, but I don‚Äôt see how that has anything to do with attrition.

Where are you going? Why is everyone dropping off the call?

This happened recently with

Shanaya from Product Thumb

, who heard

my audio post on The Layers of Customer Centricity

and created a set of accompanying visualizations. You can find her diagrams and my expanded thoughts below‚Ä¶

To me, the key to building a great product is customer centricity. Although being customer centric isn‚Äôt a guarantee of success, no compelling product ever found fit without understanding its target user. In fact, if you were to scope things to B2B products, you can get even more specific about what‚Äôs required.

reality

(an actual, named user with access to budget)

totality

(deep knowledge of the end user‚Äôs environment)

plurality

(conviction on a repeatable problem vs one off)

I purposely named the first level

reality

- you can‚Äôt move to the subsequent stages without getting through this gate. Too many B2B products are conceived outside reality - the persona is theoretical, the pain is manageable, and the budget is non-existent. Can you manufacture a product that way? Sure. But can you build a business around that product? No.

The best way I‚Äôve found to gauge

reality

is blending qual and quant research. Rather than starting with a 10k ft view of the market, begin with a 1 ft view of a user struggling to do a job.

If you‚Äôve narrowed down your idea to solving a problem for a specific user, you should also have an understanding of the other tools and processes that user interacts with. The importance of

totality

is making sure your product fits within the user‚Äôs larger workflow. Just because you see an opportunity to alleviate user pain doesn‚Äôt mean every other product they use also doesn‚Äôt see that possibility - it‚Äôs just as like an existing tool expands its capability set vs the user adopting a new tool (i.e. yours).

If you‚Äôve fully wrapped your head around the

totality

of the end-user experience, you can make smarter decisions about the entry point of your product (new interface vs plugging into existing ecosystem).

I mentioned earlier that you want to start with a 1 ft view of the user, but in order to build a business around your product you have to confirm that there is a repeatable playbook - that‚Äôs where

plurality

comes. You have to take that 1 ft view of the user and tie it back to a 10k ft view of the broader market. While

reality

and

totality

are about product market fit,

plurality

is about GTM motion fit.

Products that pass the first two tests but not this last one tend to be the center of ad-hoc services businesses - think of an agency that does custom development work vs a salesforce selling the same solution to the same problem to the same buyer across different channels / geographies / segments.

Hopefully these visuals make these ideas more concrete - feel free to share!

"The Myth of the ""Natural"" Public Speaker",https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/the-myth-of-the-natural-public-speaker,"Several years ago, I realized that talking in front of large-ish groups of people that I wasn‚Äôt on a first-name basis with was going to be an expectation of my job. I had always been fearful of public speaking, and crowds in general throw me off. So, I did what any good glossophobe would do - I jumped into the deep end of the pool and

signed up to speak at a conference

.

I had always assumed that some (more-extroverted) folks were innately gifted at speaking. That‚Äôs why (in my mind) they came across as more ‚Äúnatural‚Äù at all hands, training sessions, demo hours, live Q&A, etc. With that mindset, in the most well-intentioned fake-it-till-you-make-it sense, I decided that I could

read

my way into coming across as (being?) a better speaker. Yes, instead of working on my story narrative or drafting slides, I read a series of books. I find that most things in life can be solved with a good book.

All the key ideas from the books (referenced below) I noted in a simple 1-pager Google Doc. I then referred to this doc constantly as I prepared my talk. Every time I would get discouraged or blocked, I just went back to the doc. Here‚Äôs the gist of it:

biggest mistake happens before talk (i.e. not preparing)

the audience wants you to do well (they don‚Äôt feel stage fright)

focus on 1 person in the crowd (biggest supporter, least hater)

open with conviction (audience internalizes first impression)

grab and hold attention (counter-intuitive idea, visual cue)

highlight dissonance / build tension (no story without conflict)

slice your story in an unconventional way to pique interest

Now, whenever I have an opportunity to speak, I start with those notes. And this is where something very strange happens - that cheat sheet actually puts me at ease. Just the mantra

‚Äúthe audience wants you to do well‚Äù

is enough to change my demeanor. No, it‚Äôs not sorcery - I‚Äôve created a muscle for public speaking which I can activate via that doc. It‚Äôs a phenomenon that Joshua Foer talks about in

Moonwalking with Einstein

.

‚Äúmemory is primarily an imaginative process‚Ä¶in fact, learning, memory, and creativity are the same fundamental process directed with a different focus‚Ä¶the art and science of memory is about developing the capacity to quickly create images that link disparate ideas.‚Äù

So if you‚Äôve been under-estimating yourself and assuming you‚Äôre not a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù, stop. And if you think you can get good at it without real effort and reps, don‚Äôt. But the next time you see a really compelling speaker / talk, recognize that you‚Äôre seeing the

n-

th and final step of a process, and 1 to

n

-1 is a slow grind and real craftsmanship.

Would love to hear from readers who‚Äôve gotten better at (or just started) public speaking, and what techniques they‚Äôve employed‚Ä¶

The PM Career Ladder: Your Unofficial Guide,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/the-pm-career-ladder-your-unofficial,"Navigating career ladders is a top-of-mind topic for PMs across companies of all sizes.

Aakash Gupta

(aka

Product Growth Guy

) and I (aka

@ibscribe

) spent some time talking about the skill shifts required for level jumps, and co-wrote the post below‚Ä¶

Product managers tend to be an ambitious bunch. It‚Äôs rare to find a PM who doesn‚Äôt want to grow in their career as fast as possible.

So, a question that‚Äôs always top of mind is, ‚Äúhow can I move ahead in my career?‚Äù

The PM Career Ladder

There are about 5 or 9 steps depending on the track.

Lenny Rachitsky provided a great resource to the product community by collecting PM career ladders at

10s of companies

last year. It can be distilled into two major tracks:

There‚Äôs an IC track and a Managerial track. Not every company has the IC track, but more than half of the bigger one‚Äôs do.

What exactly is needed at each stage?

Different Skills

As you move up this ladder, you need to master totally new skills. While there‚Äôs tons of variation, it generally looks something like this:

There are two things we want to highlight here.

The first is that

as you go up in the ladder, your ability to do the items below doesn‚Äôt really decrease

.

It‚Äôs difficult to effectively lead in product management if you don‚Äôt have that base of being able to ship features, contextualize them versus past features, consider features versus

other types

of bets, etc.

The second takeaway is that

the big axis shift for you as you progress is from execution to vision

. If you‚Äôre early in your PM career, as much as strategy and vision do matter, the value you are uniquely positioned to provide relative to others¬† in the company is execution.

So, being able to ship features on time, with attention to detail, great design, and reach the goals they set out to is crucial. There‚Äôs a reason that ‚Äòship feature‚Äô sticky has big text. It‚Äôs important at each and every level, and is the rock foundation upon which everything rests.

How might we further sharpen our pencils on this?

The Three Key Phases

A few years back, Fareed Mosavat (former Director of Product at Slack) and Casey Winters (former CPO at Eventbrite)

identified

that one stage is particularly tough - the jump from senior PM to product leader.

They called it the Product Leader Canyon:

We couldn‚Äôt agree more. Inspired by that, we think there might be one more jump to add - moving from a product leader to product executive. Because again, at this step, your aperture changes dramatically.

So we might say, really, there are three stages:

Progressing Seniority

The Product Leader Canyon

Manager to Executive

The progressions looks like this:

As you move into the executive line, you are managing a whole product or multiple products. This makes your skill sets required far broader than just PM.

Today‚Äôs Piece

We‚Äôll walk through the ‚Äúearned secret‚Äù tips we have gained from working through these three phases of the PM career.

Consider this the

unofficial companion

to the career ladder your company gave you. This is the advice for accelerating through your career ladder that you used to get at in the cafeteria before everyone went hybrid/ remote. We‚Äôll walk through:

What are the

The PM Mindset Ladder,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/the-pm-mindset-ladder,"PM ladders (and career ladders in general) tend to elicit a lot of feelings. To some they are an obstacle course to navigate. To others they are a playbook for how to play the game. They can be hard to interpret, but if you look past the hard skills (

the what

) and the soft skills (

the how

) and translate them into plain English (vs jargon), you can actually have a thoughtful career planning conversation.

Below is my mental mapping for how PMs evolve, which is more oriented towards the  mode they operate in.

You can see the breadth of mindsets here ranges from ‚Äúship feature‚Äù to ‚Äúforecast market‚Äù, and there‚Äôs room here for all levels ranging from APM to CPO. Some examples of what a PM ladder overlaid on this framing could look like:

APM -> PM -> Sr. PM -> Staff / Principal PM -> Director -> VP -> CPO

PM I -> PM II -> Sr. PM -> Group PM -> Dir -> Sr. Dir -> VP -> SVP -> EVP

The simple leveling translation I use:

can you ship?

can you contextualize?

can you manage a portfolio?

can you move business metrics?

can you create value for customers?

can you translate user problems into products?

can you differentiate and derisk opportunity pursuits?

can you identify one-off vs repeatable market opportunities?

can you articulate an instinct and point of view on market evolution?

Another way to view this is 2 dimensions: execution and vision. The top left / bottom right stickies represent the extremes of those mentalities. And strategy is the through line that connects everything (see references section for more thoughts on this).

What specific titles you create depends on many factors (corporate ladders, comp ranges, people policy, incentive structure), but for a product leader I think it‚Äôs important to delinate along these lines so that you can have clear conversations with PMs on what the ‚Äúnext step‚Äù looks like.

The Power of Layering Product Choices,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/the-power-of-layering-product-choices,"Recently, I shared some

lessons from my 1st week at Amazon

, which was focused on quickly making a critical CX decision. In my experience, getting great at decision making can really super-charge an organization, and not being good at it is

the root of all dysfunction

. Our group at Box recently shipped a meaningful UX change, which was the output of stitching together a series of smaller improvements from the last 3 months; one of the PMs on my team described it as ‚Äúcompound interest paying off.‚Äù The insight was spot on, and it reminded me of a pattern of decision making I learned at Amazon.

First, let us hear from famous ex-Amazonian Albert Einstein:

‚ÄúCompound interest¬†is the 8th¬†wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn't, pays it.‚Äù

There are 2 takeaways from this, product-wise:

you can layer product choices over time to compound value

you can exacerbate product debt over time by carrying it

If you spend enough time at Amazon, you start to build this pattern-matching / decision-making muscle. And occasionally you get to flex. When I was working on the original

Fire tablet

as a PM in the Kindle org, the execs would do weekly reviews with Jeff (Bezos) and I‚Äôd get forwarded notes to decipher. One throwaway comment I read early on was ‚ÄúJeff thinks everyone that buys the tablet gets Prime‚Äù, and with all Jeff ideas it‚Äôs worth understanding‚Ä¶why? So I ambled over to the desk where the Kindle SVP / VPs sat and just asked one of them‚Ä¶why? Here was the story:

you buy the tablet (not an e-reader) and you expect a kick-ass video experience

we were already planning to put a version of our Android video app on the Fire

the concern was the OOBE* (out of the box experience) on the video tab because

you probably would have no content in your purchased / rental library to view but

there was a deal being worked on with studios to create a video library for Prime

so, let‚Äôs ‚Äúgrant‚Äù a (time-boxed) Prime subscription to everyone who buys the Fire

and then they‚Äôll have some popular titles to watch the first time they boot up

The ambition was mind-boggling. Kindles till that point had been a gateway to selling more books, with the average Kindle owner being a 10x reader. But with the Fire tablet:

you start to sell more types of long-form content (comics, textbooks, audiobooks)

you create a more compelling visual experience for a slice of content (magazines)

you are able to sell your existing digital media (music, video) via another channel

you are creating a new subscriber funnel for a very lucrative service (Prime**)

It was like a flywheel, within a flywheel, kickstarting another flywheel. And we had to get the CX right.

I sought out the PM on point and asked to understand the gameplan. The MVP was apparently to get a list of Kindle buyer emails, then send a subset an offer to sign up for Prime.

What?!? No‚Ä¶

I put on my (unofficial)

CXBR hat

and redefined it:

you auto-magically get a Prime subscription when you buy the Kindle Fire

unlike every Prime plan (e.g. student, mom) you don‚Äôt enter credit card (friction)

30 days later you get a letter on your Kindle explaining expiration / subscription

Here‚Äôs what that meant in practice:

the Subscriptions Service PM had to get on board with ‚Äúgranting‚Äù (vs buying)

the Prime Offers PM had to get on board with a plan w/o payment (blasphemy)

the Kindle Campaigns PM had to get on board with non-Kindle messaging (huh?)

What authorized / qualified me to take things back to the drawing board? As I said in my

recent post

:

‚Äúyou can make any decision with a cogent plan for why/how‚Äù

So let‚Äôs talk about the how, and this is where the compounding value of product decisions comes in. We had a service in place to trigger actions based on events (e.g. purchase event -> welcome email). The quick (and functional) solution was to hack this up to talk to a Prime service, because Jeff‚Äôs ask was explicitly

‚Äúeveryone that buys the tablet gets Prime‚Äù

, and this met the requirement. But there was a pattern here.

Were we giving temporary Prime without payment to Kindle buyers? Or were we granting digital benefits with deferred purchase for physical orders? With a higher-leverage architecture, setup for scale, and some incremental effort, we could build the latter. There was no specific use case to prioritize a more foundational solution, but I made the call anyway. Hindsight is 20/20, so when I go over this story in my head now, I honestly don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶

Was it foresight? (unlikely, although it will read like it)

Was it instinct? (not really, although it sounds very cool)

Was it culture? (probably, I‚Äôd internalized this from others)

All this solutioning happened in the early days of the product, but a few

weeks

before launch 3 crazy things happened in succession:

the music team asked if there was a way to nudge customers to download their MP3 library to their Kindle tablet (music was the 1st type of digital content Amazon sold, even before e-books, and many customers had huge libraries)

the appstore team showed up in a panic, saying Jeff wanted to give away the app of the day for free to a device buyer as a promotion option for game developers

the Prime video library idea had been expanded from studios to publishers, and now a

book library

was possible in addition to a

video library

All 3 ideas, which would create a delightful experience and insane buzz, needed some sort of generic digital benefit entitlement service. Was there such a thing? At scale?

What?!? Yes‚Ä¶

By layering your product choices and thinking long-term, you can build up to moments of immense pay-off in terms of customer value.

I‚Äôll leave you with a quote and a request to hear about your own experience with  decisions compounding in serendipitous ways‚Ä¶

‚ÄúWhen we talk about decision-making, we usually focus just on the immediate payoff of a single decision ‚Äî and if you treat every  decision as if it were your last, then indeed only exploitation makes  sense. But over a lifetime, you‚Äôre going to make a lot of decisions. ‚Äú

The Product Lexicon (v1),https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/the-product-lexicon,"There are a lot of terms tossed around when you work in product, and whether you‚Äôre new to the PM role or recently joined a company where they have their own interpretation, it helps to have a universal lexicon for clarity of communication.

I‚Äôm planning to reference these concepts regularly in future posts, so I figured I‚Äôd spell out my standard definitions. I may also occasionally append to this list‚Ä¶

Product Vision

The future state you‚Äôre trying to create / achieve by building your product, which is usually not an overnight proposition and requires a multi-year journey.

Product Strategy

The intentional steps you‚Äôll take to achieve the product vision. Imagine there are a multitude of ways to get to the end-state vision - your product strategy is the explicit path you‚Äôve chosen. A good product strategy serves as your decision-making framework, because you can easily answer whether a step makes sense to take (or not).

Product Principles

The manner in which you choose to build products, given all the options and alternatives, are your product principles. These can be thought of as operating guidelines meant to ensure consistency and resolve trade-offs.

Product Team

The cross-functional group on point to define / execute / iterate on a dimension of the strategy, with a PM usually on point as team leader / spokesperson. It takes multiple product teams working in concert to fulfill the product vision. Also, an organizational hierarchy of PMs is not a product team - it‚Äôs just the functional reporting structure.

Product Mission

The specific focus area (or charter) of a particular product team that is distinct and unique from other product teams. Ideally, there are clear operating lanes between product teams, because issues arise when there are overlapping (product dependencies) or abandoned (product debt) missions.

Product Goals

As a product team proceeds on its mission, there should be objectives and metrics to measure progress, which we refer to as product goals. Goals should not only have an absolute value (e.g. revenue $ or % growth) but also a time horizon (e.g. quarter or year); one key aspect of a product strategy is an understanding of the timeframe in which the vision must come to fruition, based on market trends, competitor analysis, etc.

Product Personas

The target users of your product or consumers of your service or customers of your business are represented by personas (which should be living profiles that you update as you learn). You may end up building for multiple distinct personas over time, and you may segment by sub-persona as well, but a minimum you should have a sense of who you are creating value for.

Product Use Cases

The specific, repeatable solutions to problems faced by your target personas which are addressed by your product are its use cases. The path to market fit and market share involves solving the right set of use cases to the right degree vs trying to do everything.

Product Functionality

The capabilities and features your product provides comprise its overall functionality. Ideally, 100% of a product‚Äôs functionality is geared towards use cases, but realistically you will end up building things that don‚Äôt add value or not enough value. When functionality that is of minimal value starts to put a drag on your ability to build or enhance your actual use cases, you end up with product debt. Sometimes, you end up with functionality that unintentionally solves a new use case, and you have (accidental) product innovation.

Product Patterns

A meta-grouping of use cases is referred to as a product pattern. This is common when building a horizontal product, where the same use case can be positioned across different industries, serving different but parallel personas. In these scenarios, the pattern refers to the 20% of the functionality that serves 80% of the horizontal use case, and additional functionality is built (or provided via partnership) to complete the industry- / persona- specific needs.

Product Backlog

The entirety of things you could potentially build are the product backlog. This encompasses original ideas from your team, demands from your customers, requests from prospects, bugs from users, input from partners, etc. Keeping a backlog groomed is a core part of a product team‚Äôs hygiene.

Product Roadmap

The specific deliverables that a product team chooses to address portions of the backlog are referred to as the product roadmap. A roadmap can be thought of as a sequencing and prioritization of a subset of the backlog. A roadmap should be intentional and jive with the product strategy; an ad-hoc roadmap implies a lack of clear product strategy. A roadmap should also employ repeatable tactics (via product principles) and result in meaningful outcomes (for product goals).

Product Pillars

A product with multiple facets can also be logically organized into product pillars. These come in handy on a variety of fronts - for example a product strategy can have pillars to break things down for internal alignment and a product roadmap can have pillars to chunk things up for external messaging.

What other terminology do you have in your product dictionary?

The Product Tree,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/the-product-tree,"Readers of this newsletter by now know my affinity for mental models - here‚Äôs a new one from the CRO of Twilio:

‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt know at the start of it the place that we actually filled in the market. It‚Äôs sort of informed an outlook that I have. There are companies that are selling a feature. In other words, you can‚Äôt use what they have unless you‚Äôre attaching it to something else. There are companies that sell products, that are collections of features. And there are companies that sell platforms. And I think markets tend towards platforms if there are scale requirements. So ultimately, over time, feature companies will disappear at tactical levels. Product companies will compete, ultimately ineffectively, against platforms.‚Äù - Marc Boroditsky

My summary of this framing:

feature

- has atomic value, but not by itself, and can differentiate and delight

solution

- solves a use case, and probably encompasses multiple features

platform

- enables an umbrella of solutions to exist and compete in the market

Note: I avoid the word ‚Äúproduct‚Äù because I see that as an overloaded term that can refer to a feature or solution or platform.

The breakdown above tends to come across as hierarchal, but I see it more as a symbiotic system. Here‚Äôs a an analogy that‚Äôs a bit of a reach, but if you think of a product as a tree:

feature == leaf

solution == branch

platform == trunk

Bonus, over-extended metaphor:

market == forest

outcome == fruit

PM == gardener || arborist

Here‚Äôs a concrete example using Amazon and it‚Äôs e-commerce offering:

feature - Amazon Prime shipping

solution - Fulfillment by Amazon

platform - Amazon Marketplace

A few thoughts come to mind once you‚Äôve internalized this model:

A product team should be aware of where it lives on the food chain, and who its natural partners and predators are

The same company could potentially offer products on multiple dimensions over time

You can‚Äôt compare features vs solutions vs platforms because the investment envelopes / payoff horizons vary big time

The only way to disrupt a market is a feature, but the only way to dominate a market is a platform

This is a bit of a free-form post (something I‚Äôll be doing more of this year), because I don‚Äôt really have an ‚Äúaha!‚Äù takeaway - just something I‚Äôm thinking about...

The Right Book at the Right Time,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/the-right-book-at-the-right-time,"It‚Äôs cheesy, but I‚Äôve always thought there was a certain magic in reading the right book at the right time.

This quote caught my eye recently and reminded me of a year of transitions I had a decade ago. In 2012, I went from scale at Amazon to scaling Twitter, came into my own as a manager, and had several life changes to boot. And I happened to read 3 books during that year that have shaped my approach to work (and life) over the last 10 years.

So what are these evergreen books? And what were my notes-to-self as I read them?

The Effective Executive

This book taught me that time management is

the

foundational skill for a leader.

managing time as the most precious resource

blocking off time to actually work

measuring time to make adjustments

efficiency is not effectiveness

outcomes over output, which requires operating on a longer time horizon

focus on high-leverage vs time spent

Essentialism

My takeaway from this book was the need to be

intentional

about your choices.

discipline required when trying to scale but used to saying yes to everything

started journey on strategic learning (vs tactical execution)

multi-tasking is a myth and single-tracking is how real problem solving happens

living intentionally vs going along with status meetings, career ladders, etc

not feeling guilty about saying ‚Äúno‚Äù - origin of principle ‚Äúno is a complete sentence‚Äù

not chasing optionality, just because it‚Äôs en vogue to not commit

Creativity Inc

This book has tons of best practices on building an org that

outlasts

you.

operationalized feedback systems are critical for a self-learning org

psychological safety required to communicate and experiment, otherwise isolated incrementalism

great teams vs great charters - diversity of team in every sense

getting team to express it‚Äôs diversity in ideating, decisions, etc

Transitioning to PM,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/transitioning-to-pm,"Other than folks who started as an APM in their first job out of college, most folks cross over to PM. Think about that. Most PMs didn‚Äôt start as PMs. I get a lot of questions from readers about how to transition to the role, and the first thing I remind them of (because they‚Äôre usually discouraged by how long it‚Äôs taking) is how common the journey is. But what are the common paths to take?

This isn‚Äôt a post about the usual hiring competencies / interview questions for a PM - there‚Äôs plenty of literature on that. What I‚Äôve highlighted above is the 3 abilities that a PM can bring to the table that an organization would value disproportionately; to the point where a role change would make sense.

domain knowledge

- this is the most common route‚Ä¶you have so much subject matter expertise that you handle on customer needs / prospect expectations / market positioning / competitive landscape puts you in a position to leverage those insights‚Ä¶think of a developer who moves over to PM developer product, or a healthcare professional who becomes a PM for healthcare tech

cross function

- so much of PM-ing is cross-functional leadership without authority‚Ä¶there are roles (e.g. GM) where you actually manage multiple function, and that mindset of balancing different perspectives to think about the customer delivery in a 360 way is highly valuable‚Ä¶you see this in large companies with horizontal pods, where 1 leader is setup to manage eng / QA / ops and be accountable for business outcomes‚Ä¶such a role can be a jumping off point to an individual contributor PM role

change agent

- at the heart of being a PM is a transformation gene, the ability to have a PoV on where things are vs where they could / should be, and aligning a bunch of partners to work in concert to achieve that future state vision‚Ä¶the opportunities for new-to-PM-ing folks of this ilk are available in industries and companies going through disruption (because of technology / policy / etc)

The above outlook is how a company willing to take a chance on someone who hasn‚Äôt officialy been a PM before might be thinking. But how can you position yourself to be a candidate that resonates?

The intersecting capabilities above can net out into 3 different PM archetypes:

operator

= domain knowledge

x

cross function

influencer

= cross function

x

change agent

innovater

= domain knowledge

x

change agent

If you can position yourself as proficient in operating in one of these modes, you‚Äôre demonstrating your PM potential. By the way, your current role is often the best place to identify the need and showcase your potential, which is why many PM moves happen at existing companies vs external transitions.

Hopefully this is helpful (and encouraging) to everyone looking to shift to PM!

Types of Product Innovation,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/types-of-product-innovation,"I've been thinking about the different ways products are invented, and so far I've enumerated these different ""invention categories"" that are the foundation for something new...what am I missing?

1/

technology

...obvious...many products are the result of new tech

2/

workflow

...re-imagining a workflow to be simpler is common

3/

financial

...this is a new one for me, but some products involve introducing new forms of payments / transactions whereby the innovator takes a cut

4/

logistical

...some products are built on the back of improvements to physical distribution...think Uber rideshare fleet or Amazon fulfillment centers

5/

models

...not sure this is a category but some products are the result of a new abstraction / framework...for example a navigation map or a game controller...before these things navigating the physical / virtual world was trial and error or just impossible

6/

brand

...many companies are built on mimetic desire and people buy their products to be associated with the brand...this is a type of innovation but it's unclear (other than great / timeless / long-term marketing) how this happens

7/

behavioral

...I'm still mulling over whether this is a category or a side product...for example Instagram makes it normal to share selfies or Kindle convinces you to buy tons of books...user behavior changes...but is this just because of technology or is there a complementary UX innovation as well?

8/

network

...sometimes a product unlocks a type of collaboration or exchange that was previously not possible...marketplaces are a great example (from the old world bazaar to web examples like eBay or Craigslist)

9/

community

...many products benefit from building mindshare with their userbase...for example IKEA hacking as a subculture generates business for IKEA ultimately

10/

communication

...this might be a subcategory of technology but things like cell phones or video conference or even email are foundational product inventions

11/

multi-category

...there might be inventions that arise from the intersection of other mini innovations...like the Internet is a cross between communication, technology, and network inventions

12/

complementary

...some inventions require parallel innovation...MP3s as a music format and portable music players like the iPod have a symbiotic relationship

Typing vs Tapping,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/typing-vs-tapping,"‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to ascertain where you stand in your managerial abstraction ability.‚Äù

Huh? Who talks like that?

The above is from a job interview I had several years ago. The interviewer was trying to assess my management skills. When I asked him to elaborate, he explained that a professional (in his view) went through 3 stages (and 2 evolutions) in their career:

individual

manager

managing managers

There was some truth in there, but it felt like an over-simplification. In my mind, management was a spectrum, and you could dial the knob in either direction depending on the context. But I didn‚Äôt have a better framework for explaining my point of view, so I just said I was level 3 and left it at that. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Until now.

we were talking about the spectrum of typers to tappers‚Ä¶typers are hardcore workers, hands-on-keyboard people‚Ä¶they generally have less leverage, but then my buddy, he was with the CEO of a firm and he said that his biggest insight from spending a bit of time with him was that he was a tapper and that he had so much leverage on his time that his career could all be done by tapping on a phone screen‚Ä¶and the fundamental takeaway was that he's directing the flow of a gushing river‚Ä¶

This is an excerpt from a podcast (linked below). The spectrum I‚Äôd envisioned fits cleanly on this range of typers and tappers.

As an individual contributor you are all about typing (code, specs, designs). As a ‚Äúlead‚Äù you vacillate back and forth between typing and tapping. As a manager, you‚Äôre supposed to be tapping but you can end up typing in a pinch. And as an executive, your tapping should be brief, firm, and sporadic.

I like this analogy because it can help you catch yourself when you are drifting into a mode that doesn‚Äôt align with the expectations of your role / team.

When the Users Were Right All Along: How Flickr Came Back from the Brink

https://lu.ma/j8qjv0r0

Friday August 9th @ 9AM (Pacific time)

‚ÄãFlickr was a beloved Web 2.0 pioneer, but by 2018, it was losing money, losing users, and had decidedly lost its way. Divested from Yahoo and acquired by SmugMug, Flickr had a chance to reinvent itself, free from the constraints of its corporate parent ‚Äî but without Yahoo‚Äôs deep pockets, it quickly had to stand on its own for the first time in over a decade.

Join this session with two product leaders as they discuss how Flickr got back to health by listening to users, narrowing its focus, and having the conviction to ask users to pay a fair price for a great product.

The Executive Mindset

https://lu.ma/51t644j3

Friday August 16th @ 4PM (Pacific time)

‚ÄãSucceeding as an executive does not mean doing more of what previously made you successful in your career. It requires a completely different mindset.

‚ÄãIn this discussion, Eric Nehrlich will share how successful executives think differently to have greater impact and scale themselves as leaders, based on his experience working with top Google executives as the Search Ads Chief of Staff, and in coaching dozens of executives to greater impact.

Mapping & Measuring Critical User Journeys

https://lu.ma/vxigl5zm

Friday August 23rd @ 9AM (Pacific time)

‚ÄãIn this session, Jon and Ibrahim will discuss how you as a product manager can understand the truly critical user journeys for a product, how to map them and link them to your company's strategy, and how to measure them in a way that helps you prioritize as well as communicate with .

‚Äã‚ÄãJoin this session because:

When the Users Were Right All Along,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/when-the-users-were-right-all-along,"I‚Äôm really enjoying finding interesting leaders who can share compelling stories via this video series. Earlier this week I chatted with

Andrew Stadlen

, former VP of Product at Flickr, about what can only be described as a Matryoshka dolls series of M&A:

2005: Yahoo buys Flickr

2013: Flickr buys IQ Engines (Andrew‚Äôs company)

2016: Verizon buys Yahoo

2017: Verizon rebrands Yahoo + AOL into Oath

2018: SmugMug acquires Flickr from Oath

The number transactions and speed of transitions are enough to give you whiplash, but Andrew did a great job of organically telling the story of multiple strategy pivots and peeling back the layer of the onion on how diligence and integration actually work.

Check out the whole conversation in this video episode. Note the full video is only for paying subscribers, so if you haven‚Äôt upgraded yet, you can do so via the link below.

We started the conversation talking about the original niche that Flickr carved out in the photography community, with Andrew sharing an example of the depth of content that was available (and still is).

Flickr became this thing where people could come together over their topic of interest around photography and form community and form relationships and friendships there.

But at some point during Yahoo‚Äôs shepherding of Flickr, multiple simultaneous growth strategies were employed, pulling the product in different directions:

become a stock photo licensing business competing with Getty Images

become a mass-scale consumer photo sharing application like Instagram

become the de facto personal photo storage platform ala Google Photos

Somewhat confounding, none of these strategies were designed to leverage Flickr‚Äôs core differentiators around content authenticity and community engagement. And it was all compounded by a culture that was not oriented around talking to and learning from users (who had originally made the platform what it was).

Our discussion also covered a really interesting tension around the importance of Flickr as a brand to Yahoo compared to the cost to run Flickr as a service. Eventually risings infrastructure costs, legacy user promises, and tricky licensing agreements painted Flickr into a corner and led to Verizon / Yahoo looking to spin out the product.

You have to watch the whole video to hear about all the potential suitors, their strategic hypotheses, and why their plans eventually didn‚Äôt pan out. But when SmugHug enters the picture (get it!) you immediately know there is a match:

SmugMug‚Äôs ‚Äúirrational love of the product‚Äù was a ray of hope and the start of a new chapter. What I found a bit counter-intuitive about the SmugMug + Flickr thesis discussions was the focus on

possibility instead of probability

. Is there a scenario where this works versus all the reasons it can‚Äôt work? We touched on a similar theme in a recent

60 Minute Stories

episode (

Like a Bullet Hitting JELL-O

) which also covered how M&A deals get constructed and executed.

I asked Andrew the

same question I had asked Jack (Butter.ai CEO) / Joel (Box Head of Corporate Development) about post-deal integration in the prior episode

, and he had a 3-part framework for a successful merger:",2025-03-01,when-the-users-were-right-all-along-2025-03-01
Why Buy?,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/why-buy,"One of my (good) habits at work is watching deal notes to see why we‚Äôre winning or losing customers - it‚Äôs a great way to keep a pulse on what‚Äôs actually happening in the market vs pitching ideas in your cushy product strategy circle (where there are no sales quotas or churn events).

In one of these recent conversations with our go-to-market team, a sales rep shared an amazing lead qualification framework with me. It was basically a gut-check to see if the opportunity was legit:

Why buy anything?

Why buy our product?

Why buy right now?

Now, I‚Äôm not in sales, and maybe this is 101 stuff, but I think it nails how to think about positioning your product - and also highlights what a lot of products get wrong.

Why buy anything? Many PMs assume that their cool idea / technical innovation has an audience. This baseline question cuts to to the heart of product market fit - is there even a clear user problem that your target customer is aware of?

Why buy our product? Assuming there is a worthy problem to solve, how does our solution rise above the crowd? I‚Äôve written before about how PM-ing is all about having a point of view on the market - this question highlights the need to have a unique stance.

Why buy right now? If you can solve a real problem with a standout solution, there‚Äôs still the issue of timing to overcome. That‚Äôs what this question raises - how many times has a good product been too early to market? Or been mis-positioned at the wrong price point, to the wrong buyer, with an implementation and adoption cost too heavy for the user to bear?

Stepping back, these questions can help frame the 3 key elements of a solid product positioning:

Why buy anything?

customer pain

Why buy our product?

key differentiators

Why buy right now?

compelling event

So the next time you‚Äôre in that product strategy circle pitching ideas, remember to evaluate them by asking about customer pain, key differentiators, and compelling events‚Ä¶because your sales team needs those answers.

Why Moving Upmarket in B2B Works,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/why-moving-upmarket-in-b2b-works,"A very common journey for B2B software companies is to build a product for the low-end (in terms of deal size / market segment), achieve product-market fit (PMF), then scale the business by taking that solution ‚Äúupmarket‚Äù to larger accounts (i.e. enterprises). A lot of ink has been spilled on how to pull of this go-to-market (GTM) motion shift quickly, cleanly, and cost effectively. It usually involves hiring a field sales team, managing accounts in a more hands-on manner, being more targeted in your outbound, relying on intermediaries and proxies that cover the domain/industry for pipeline, and priming accounts for regular up-sells and cross-sells. The industry is full of companies that successfully pulled off this maneuver, to that degree that attempting it is not even seen as risky strategy, but rather a scaling milestone.

I don‚Äôt want to rehash how to ‚Äúmove upmarket‚Äù here. I‚Äôm more curious as to why it actually works. Most of the playbooks you‚Äôll find around going upmarket tell you what you need to do from your company‚Äôs perspective; they walk you through how your product, your motion, your messaging need to evolve. But what‚Äôs actually going on in the market that makes such a play successful? I‚Äôm curious about recurring customer behavior that enables B2B product companies to repeatedly start downmarket and move upmarket once they have PMF.

What‚Äôs interesting about living downmarket is PMF is critical. By definition, you‚Äôre building something for a high volume of customers, so the problems you‚Äôre solving need to be universal (or at least regularly recurring). One-off problems / solutions are not a recipe for repeatability. So when B2B product companies start on the low-end (think SMB or Commercial space), they are forced to identify the most critical and concentrated use cases. To contrast that with going upmarket, your mindset shifts to solving peripheral problems that are more custom, because you‚Äôre incentivized to pack more into your existing distribution channel vs finding new channels (i.e. easier to renew / expand existing customers vs landing net new accounts).

So how does this idea of PMF being critical downmarket explain why companies find it easier to move upmarket? Well, if you actually achieve fit downmarket, you‚Äôve likely got some fans. You‚Äôve helped some buyers / users become heroes in their organizations. You‚Äôve manufactured some champions. And these champions are the key.

If you look at things from the perspective of a large enterprise organization, their challenges usually can be summarized as follows:

innovation slowing down

losing share to newcomers

struggling to attract top talent

losing PR battle in market

And what do they do to tackle this?

innovation slowing down ‚Üí hire from smaller, more innovative companies

losing share to newcomers ‚Üí lure away top talent from upstart competition

struggling to attract top talent ‚Üí promise new hires they can change culture

losing PR battle in market ‚Üí tell a story around new talent, brewing innovation

So the people working at smaller, innovative companies who end up working at larger, enterprise corporations come in with a particular mindset around innovation, expecting to change the culture, looking to utilize the tools and rituals they‚Äôre used to. This pool of talent that‚Äôs move from downmarket to upmarket is the group of champions you‚Äôve helped manufacture. And the biggest reason that B2B products can start downmarket and move upmarket is that‚Äôs how talent flows.

tl;dr

if you‚Äôre able to manufacture champions with your product and they view your tool as part of their ‚Äúmust have stack‚Äù, you‚Äôre set up to ride the talent wave.

As always, I‚Äôd also love to hear from readers about their attempts to shift their GTM motion - please chime in via commentsüëá or join the chat via the Substack app.

Why Platform-ify?,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/why-platform-ify,"I recently got a great reader mailbag question that prompted me to write a long form response and turn it into a full blog post (see below). The tl;dr is the reader was trying to get advice on how to make a business case for better integrating different products that had been built/acquired piecemeal over the years. And to me, the fact that point solutions were being sold under the same umbrella with no cross-product unification was a sign that basic bundling had been achieved, but proper integration had not. And there was a resistance to platform-ing. Read on for the whole story.

Also note, I have 2 upcoming interviews as part of

60 Minute Stories

that you won‚Äôt want to miss:

Jon Fan discussing Why You‚Äôll Always End Up Building a Workflow Engine in B2B

and

Aaron Smith talking about Leveraging 100% of Your Company's Brain

. Both events are free, live, virtual webinars‚Ä¶but seats are limited so sign up today!

In so many companies today, there is a tendency to grow via acquisition. This is particularly true at ours. And while we've acquired, our products retain so much autonomy that they have a high level of variability between products in the same portfolio.

Is there a best practice, tradeoff, business justification process that you've seen in industry to re-evaluate some core capabilities to align those products on a common licensing mechanism, consumption models, or simplification and alignment of business models in order to better support customers and to decrease unique internal costs of infrastructure, marketing that are tied to individual products?

It seems like an obvious question to me, and I have examples of other companies like Microsoft, Adobe, Autodesk doing this to products during their business model transformations, but I don't know where apart from press releases that I could make a business case for my leadership for this approach.

The starting point for me is acknowledgement that putting together adjacent solutions in a B2B context makes sense and just works -

products are workflows

after all. So credit to this company for building and acquiring complementary pieces. But in B2B products you are fundamentally dealing with (at least) 2 personas (more on this in a future post):

the buyer - who wants unification from a purchase/renewal perspective

the user - who wants unification from an activation/adoption perspective

And this is where the question gets interesting. Many companies solve for [1] by bundling products, offering discounts, incentivizing reps, and optimizing cross-sells. But that is just 1/2 the puzzle. In order to actually get happy customers serving as references (your best future source of pipeline), you‚Äôll need them to actually deploy and utilize your product. And that‚Äôs where integration comes in. Make the sum greater than the parts‚Ä¶1+1 =3 as it were.

There are 3 rationales for the type of ""unification"" work the reader is trying to justify to the business:

Time to Value

Repeatable Motion

Cost to Serve

In order to get customers to value, true ‚Äúsolved our business problem in a delightful way such that we‚Äôll talk about it on stage at your conference‚Äù value, you have to reduce (or even remove) the cognitive load on the part of the end-user navigating your product and the admin working to configure and manage it. And when you have inconsistent components, patterns, and flows in different parts of your products (because it was built or bought piecemeal), you are adding friction on the path to value. When users who took the time to ramp up on your product are presented with different paradigms and forced to learn new mental models, they‚Äôre left with a bait-and-switch feeling. Don‚Äôt make it harder for people to ‚Äúget good‚Äù at your product.

Beyond your users, having a streamlined product helps your GTM motion as well - whether you have an internal sales team or rely on external partners, getting them to consistently sell and deploy the same use case with minimal customization is the path to repeatability. And repeatability is what separates a product business from a services business. If your portfolio has 3 products (X, Y, Z), imagine how much extra work you‚Äôre creating for your marketing, sales, support, and success departments with different demos and docs for each. With shared widgetry across X, Y, Z, you can not only have consistent demos and docs, you can have a consistent playbook for land and expand. The time to ramp up new sales or support people gets drastically reduced and you have more value from generalists vs the need for specialists. Again, don‚Äôt make it harder for people, even employees, to ‚Äúget good‚Äù at your product.

And the last reason for unifying is to reduce costs. Whether it‚Äôs the testing load for different components or infrastructure bills for different clouds, you tap into economies of scale with a unified tech stack. Any time your technical teams (engineering, premium support, data analytics, developer relations) are spending maintaining different versions of the same thing is time they‚Äôre not spending improving the end-user facing functionality of your product (which is what customers are actually buying). Whether it‚Äôs a shared design language or shared back-end services, you unlock new product development velocity when developers can ramp up on the codebase (and again ‚Äúget good‚Äù) more quickly.

Now, the counter-argument you'll get to this business justification to unify the product is team autonomy / speed of execution. If you let a thousand flowers bloom, you‚Äôll fill out the garden faster. But my counter to that counter? Is that a garden that‚Äôs appealing to the community? Is a product with more features that don‚Äôt work well together appealing to your users? When you are just a collection of parts bundled together, are you stuck at 1+1=2? Your differentiation, when compared to point solutions or other commercial bundles, is that you have the potential to have 1+1=3.

The last point I want to make is that when you decompose your product into logical building blocks and reconstitute it in a more intentional way, you open up the door to something bigger: a platform. With a standard alphabet and shared vocabulary, you can not only communicate with your desired audience consistently and clearly, but you also allow others to extend and expand on your language, which in turn can be a gateway to new audiences. I‚Äôm a big fan of this quote from

Steve Yegge‚Äôs Google / Amazon Platforms Rant

:

A product is useless without a platform, or more precisely and accurately, a platform-less product will always be replaced by an equivalent platform-ized product.

Why You‚Äôll Always End Up Building a Workflow Engine in B2B,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/why-youll-always-end-up-building,"Readers know that I have a lot of theories and frameworks about

building and scaling B2B products

, so when my former colleague from Box

Jon Fan

(now Head of Product at BioRender) and I decided to do a

60 Minute Stories

episode, we immediately gravitated towards that topic. One aspect in particular that we wanted to drill into being the tendency of every (successful) SaaS product to slowly but surely become a workflow engine. I tried to articulate this once with a concept called

Skip Step SaaS

(and an infamous ‚Äúbarn diagram‚Äù). And Jon kicked off our conversation by highlighting that most B2B products are ‚Äúreplacing at least one step in a workflow‚Äù.

Products are workflows

after all. The example Jon provides to illustrate this is one from his time at Benchling where they built ‚ÄúEvernote for scientists‚Äù. One really insightful takeaway I got from Jon was that when moving a workflow from analog to digital, you can unlock new capabilities by structuring and automating the workflow in ways that weren‚Äôt possible before.

Beyond the value for end users, you can also provide the orchestrators and administrators of the workflow visibility in a more unified manner - a ‚Äúsingle pane of glass‚Äù as it were. For any product that is able to become the definitive solution to a workflow problem, you are now set up to be the center of a larger ecosystem where partners orient around your view of the workflow.

We also got a great question from the audience on when, where, and how to expand a product‚Äôs workflow scope. In this clip I share some heuristics on signals to look for as a starting point:

Jon also tied all this product thinking around workflow simplification to the parallel concern from GTM on increasing the surface to sell to and the larger business goal of addressable market expansion.

In our hour together, Jon and I also dive into a variety of other aspects to this topic, including:

WMT Interview Questions,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/wmt-interview-questions,"I‚Äôve been doing a lot of interviews lately (hiring PMs for my team @ Amplitude), and all the phone screens reminded of how much I enjoy a good back and forth. I‚Äôm especially a fan of open-ended, multi-layered, tangent-spawning questions that can fill up the allotted time. I was opining about this on LinkedIn the other day, and someone asked for an example, so I wrote these up along with the

why?

behind each of them.

‚Äúwalk me through an instance of you disagreeing and committing with an executive or peer on what direction to take your product in‚Äù

from this I can learn:

if you‚Äôve ever disagreed and committed

if you‚Äôve dealt with executive pressure

if you can connect strategy <-> tactics

if you focus on being right or rigorous

if you can remember how it netted out

‚Äúwalk me through a product trade-off where the data in your hands vs the intuition in your head didn‚Äôt jive, and how you made sense of it‚Äù

from this I can learn:

what level of trade-offs you have made

if you use data and to what degree

do you over-rely on data to guide

how you build / refine product instinct

if you follow curiosity or index on delivery

‚Äúwalk me through a contentious product decision that you helped navigate where there were legitimate points of view on multiple sides‚Äù

from this I can learn:

how you operate in a group dynamic

methods you use to get to decisions

what you optimize for in decisions

if you can argue other points of view

‚Äúwalk me through a series of product bets you were part of that ended up in compounding value for your customer / step function change in your business ‚Äú

from this I can learn:

do you think in chunks (multi-release)

can you break down work to de-risk

can you tell a long-term story

what lens (customer, business) you use

‚Äúwalk me through a time when you made a trade-off between experience and cost, and the eventual outcome of the situation‚Äù

from this I can learn:

your ability to build a business case

if you can align business and customer outcomes

how you balance inherent tension

how you gauge things that are hard to quantify

how you think about the customer working backwards

Since they all start with

‚Äúwalk me through‚Äù

I refer to them as

WMTs

. I hope these are helpful, no matter which side of the interview you‚Äôre on. And of course, they‚Äôre not unique to PM interviews - you easily replace the term

What would your questions be to learn if leaders have this kind of thinking baked into their companies' mindset and philosophies?

And I thought I would answer it in the style of my ‚Äúwalk me through‚Äù (WMT) interview questions I‚Äôve used before.

‚ÄúWalk me through a cross-team collaboration you initiated or simplified that resulted in a win-win for each team‚Äù

from this you can learn:

how willing they are to work horizontally vs relying on hierarchy

whether they understand that not all work can be owned by 1 team

if they have experience navigating complex dependency management

‚ÄúWalk me through a series of bets you made that ended up in compounding value for your customer‚Äù

from this you can learn:

if they believe in long-term planning and execution vs short term only

whether they‚Äôve been able to break complex problems into chunks

how they get buy-in for making multi-part, phased investments

‚ÄúWalk me through a strategy shift you undertook that resulted in a step function change for your business‚Äù

from this you can learn:

whether they‚Äôve ever even attempted a strategy pivot (successful or not)

if they can articulate what a 10x change (vs incremental) looks like

how they think about top-level business impact and metrics

‚ÄúWalk me through the last product line / feature set you sunsetted and why‚Äù

from this you can learn:

whether they‚Äôve actually killed features and divested bets of any weight

how they navigate customer comms and field perception when removing value

if they think of sunsetting as a way to manage debt, increase focus, improve CX‚Ä¶

‚ÄúWalk me through an instance of increasing funding / staffing for a team based on promising signals (qual or quant) you saw‚Äù

from this you can learn:

whether they have a mental model for when and how to double down

how they handle dialing up 1 investment while dialing down another

if they can blend qual and quant insights or over-rely on 1 signal

‚ÄúWalk me through a scope change decision you made that resulted in a team slipping its release date commit‚Äù

from this you can learn:

if they are willing to change / sacrifice ship dates for a bigger goal

what their bar is for adding / removing scope from a project

how well they handle communication and buy-in for scope change

‚ÄúWalk me through the last case of regretted attrition on your team and what you learned from that departure‚Äù

from this I can learn:

if they have ever even had a regretted departure (no example is either lack of experience, lack of honesty, or lack of learning from that scenario)

whether they can put themselves in the shoes of the departing person and articulate how / why they hit a career plateau and chose to go elsewhere

how they changed their leadership style to prevent from happening again

‚ÄúWalk me through a hard lesson you learned from your customers / partners / competitors that came later than you liked‚Äù

from this you can learn:

how they deal with blind spots and whether they take accountability or blame

what constitutes a ‚Äúhard lesson‚Äù for them (wasted time, wasted resources, etc)

whether they have a growth mindset and a good barometer for healthy pace of learning (some folks are way off in terms of how fast / slow insights should come)

Work With Me,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/work-with-me,"I offer a variety of ways for clients to work with me and tap into my operating experience and domain expertise‚Ä¶

Writing

This is my primary passion and the basis of all my other work - if you‚Äôd like to commission me for a guest column, magazine article, or visual infographic please reach out. I‚Äôm also open to collaborations and have co-written posts for several blogs. Lastly, I‚Äôve yet to do a sponsorship but I‚Äôm open to ideas and pitches.

Speaking

I love being on podcasts and panels, especially to delve into topics I‚Äôve written about. I‚Äôve also given keynote talks at several conferences and am dedicated to continually improving my public speaking skills. You can see some

examples of my speaking engagements here

. Let me know if you want to book me for your next meetup or webinar.

Teaching

I currently teach a

class on Maven

but have also done custom workshops on a variety of topics around building teams, shipping products, and repeating outcomes. If you think I can help educate, energize, and/or entertain your product team, drop me a line. I really enjoy tailoring my frameworks to a particular domain / organization to deliver a personalized and impactful training.

Hiring

Talent is the lifeblood of every high-performing team, and finding, nurturing, and deploying people who want to do the best work of their professional lives has been the most rewarding part of my career. I like to operate at the intersection of the talent marketplace and relish helping both product folks who need guidance on how to approach the market and execs / recruiters who are looking to source, close, and onboard top product leaders.

Advising

If you‚Äôre pinging me to run your product org, perhaps consider me for a short-term advisory relationship where I can help figure out business strategy, org design, and product roadmap in a way that your eventual hire is set up for success. I‚Äôve seen a lot of successful scaling in my time as a leader at Amazon, Twitter, Box, and Amplitude and I‚Äôve worked on every kind of product (DTC and B2B), so I‚Äôm keen to apply those learnings in new contexts. I‚Äôve also run every kind of PM team (core, add-on, platform, growth, 0-to-1) and gone through every type of development cycle (build, buy, partner) so I‚Äôm confident I can add value to and create clarity for your unique situation.

Coaching

I have 10+ years of experience building and scaling cross-functional teams, and my

personal north star metric

is the # of people who consider me their best boss ever / their first call for career advice. My coaching sessions can take several forms, including 1:1 mentorship for individual contributor PMs, leadership development for new managers, and exec coaching for Heads of Product / Directors / VPs.

Use the button below to message me and start a dialogue about working together. Please note my fees vary based on the complexity of the request, but I do a lot of free work as well based on my interest level / network favors, so don‚Äôt hesitate to ask‚Ä¶

Writing is Building,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/writing-is-building,"I‚Äôve been thinking recently about what I‚Äôm building with this newsletter. More and more, I find myself treating it like a product. So much so that I actually drew out the workflow I go through and how the flywheel operates.

There are fundamentally 2 major components:

It‚Äôs a bit chicken and egg, but basically new / engaging content leads to audience growth, and the growing audience feeds my backlog of content production.

But there‚Äôs slightly more nuance here:

When I‚Äôm focused on content, I‚Äôm either creating or distributing - and although I didn‚Äôt know it when I started, distribution is on equal fotting with creation. With regards to my audience, my primary near-term goal is cultivation with an eye towards future monetization.

Now, there‚Äôs nothing that unique about this workflow; I imagine most content businesses (individual book authors, newspaper holding companies, solo TikTok influencers, etc) have a similar flywheel.

But there are some points of divergence:

The content is not the product; it‚Äôs a path to building an audience, which will serve as the market for my eventual product - so many of the traditional rules about content businesses may be irrelevant

The scale of content production is very very small (a couple of posts a month, maybe 1-2 a week if I‚Äôm in peak writing mode) - the only ways to scale are full-time focus or a team, and while I‚Äôve dabbled in collaboration, I don‚Äôt see how to maintain authenticity and quality if ‚Äúscaling content‚Äù becomes the goal

Content distribution and audience cultivation are still evolving practices at such a small scale - independent writers don‚Äôt have  access to the channels and budgets of media companies, they don‚Äôt have established business models to plug into, and in fact there are a ton of newsletters / websites around how to make it in ""the creator economy‚Äù popping up‚Ä¶in short, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs figured out yet

It‚Äôs a bit meta, but I think the products that someone like me would need to do what I‚Äôm doing with less overhead / more success is where my mind keeps going - so I actually broke out the flywheel above into the workflow components

A few takeaways to note:

The colors indicate where one branch leads to another node - for example, I can be in content creation mode, writing a preview of an upcoming post, and that is a segue into distribution mode

There are a lot of different tools and channels I‚Äôm always jumping back and forth between, and while Substack has collapsed of lot of point solutions into 1, there is plenty that happens off-Substack (especially on the distribution front)

My north star metric is essentially ‚Äúsize of actionable audience‚Äù, but it‚Äôs still unclear what action I want that audience to take - the monetization paths that seem to be work for most creators (paywalls, sponsorships) don‚Äôt fit my ethos, and the ones that have materialized (teaching, consulting) are really hard to do repeatably

Because I‚Äôm trying to apply product thinking to this endeavor, I spent some time thinking about the worklow gaps / friction I face right now:

note: the clear clouds are the problems and the grayed in clouds are the solutions

I write based on mood, but I think some way to ‚Äútime‚Äù posts based on my current reading / prior notes / zeitgeist trends would be great

The entire distribution flow pre- and post- publishing is quite a lot of work - every platform (LinkedIn, Twitter) has its own optimized formatting / timing, and while I know there are solutions for scheduling, I think real engagement engagement with the part of the audience that participates in your learning is hard amidst the noise

The cross-platform analysis of how an actionable audience is growing and when to do something about is doesn‚Äôt exists - Substack telling me which subscribers are 5 stars vs 1 star is kind of useless - the magic questions I‚Äôm looking for answers to are ‚Äúwho would come to a meetup?‚Äù ‚Äúwho would spend the time co-writing with me?‚Äù ‚Äúwho would build a microSaaS solution to this problem?‚Äù

As someone who consumes a lot of content, I find myself going down rabbit holes and reading blogs / watching YouTube videos / listening to podcasts on a niche topic - I feel like 1 of my blog posts can easily be stretched into different mediums across different channels, but right now that‚Äôs me tl;dr-ing and dabbling in new formats - I don‚Äôt know if a tool for this exists, but I think that‚Äôs going to be a critical part of the future content creator tech stack

I find getting ‚Äúconversion‚Äù (i.e. subscription) works best in the moment (i.e. right after you like by Twitter thread you get a DM highlighting that I have a newsletter) - but that is really hard to keep up with and is ripe for automation

I know this was a bit of a meandering post, but I‚Äôm trying to balance my dual desires to build products and create knowledge, and my current thinking is there‚Äôs an audience overlap there. Time will tell‚Ä¶

Writing is Compounding,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/writing-is-compounding,"A recently-hired colleague at work shared an insight with me this week that hadn‚Äôt dawned on me before: onboarding is 80% self-directed learning and 20% tapping into tribal knowledge. Wouldn‚Äôt it be great if the tribal knowledge was documented, accessible, and structured?

Yes recently-hired colleague, yes it would!

The discussion reminded of an episode from my Twitter days, when a tongue-in-cheek wiki comment was taken seriously. I had written the first onboarding wiki on Confluence for the technical PM team, and someone who was in the middle of onboarding read and it said a bunch of things were missing. So I updated the wiki with a comment at the bottom:

‚Äúif you think something is missing from this wiki, feel free to add it yourself‚Äù

I was at Twitter for over 5 years, and I don‚Äôt think I looked at that wiki again till my last week. Guess what? People took the comment seriously, and had been adding to it. Every new hire (~ 50 people over 5 years) layering insight after nugget. It was the collective in-house and long-lost knowledge base of the techincal PM team, available to read in < 30 minutes for any new hire.

This is more than a warm and fuzzy story. This is one of the realities of writing: it compounds.

Whether it‚Äôs an onboarding doc that‚Äôs updated by every new hire or a product brief that goes through a series of reviews or an incident post-mortem that‚Äôs studied by every on-call, the act of writing, sharing, and editing is critical to an organization that wants to learn.

Writing is Connecting ,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/writing-is-connecting,"I‚Äôve been reflecting a lot recently on why I started this newsletter / blog, with an eye towards figuring out how it evolves in 2021. I attempted to explain the spark when I kicked it off (back in April) and when I reached my original milestone (100 subscribers). But somewhere along the way, I either changed my intent or discovered another path, and it‚Äôs a byproduct of what writing has allowed me to do: connect.

It seems obvious in hindsight, but creating on the internet is how many people connect to community. And writing is just one instance of creation. Sharing lessons, iterating on ideas, and learning together on a global scale with a good bit of serendipity mixed in - there‚Äôs really no other experience like it.

Let me elaborate on the serendipity bit‚Ä¶

A few months into writing, someone I met in a professional capacity mentioned off-hand that they‚Äôd read my posts when they looked me up on LinkedIn (my primary broadcast channel). I mentioned it was a side hustle, a creative outlet. She mentioned her side hustle, her creative outlet: a podcast. Would I be interested in recording an episode sometime? Sure.

That conversation brought me to a realization - my writing had led to a clarity of thought, a formulation of opinions, some real points of view, and I was more confident in sharing them. In fact, some of my ideas were languishing as draft posts precisely because they required a longer-form, expository format. I reached out cold on LinkedIn to the hosts of product podcasts that I actually listened to on a regular basis, and was quickly scheduled for recordings, using this newsletter as my primary proof of credibility.

3 podcasts in 3 months. The reach from those episodes went way beyond my original 100 subscriber plateau.

The random-ness doesn‚Äôt stop there.

Each podcast then spawned a slew of Twitter and LinkedIn discussions as it was shared and re-shared. Every time I figured the notifications had peaked, there would be a new wave. And every wave brought with it affirmation that there was an audience for my writing, a community for me.

I was offered a speaking slot at a virtual / digital conference; I took it, used my draft writing to create the content, and then redirected the attendees to my newsletter for more (that basically got me from 100 -> 200 subscribers in short order).

I slowly realized that I had evergreen content - I didn‚Äôt need the recency-biased Twitter and LinkedIn algorithms to get me eyeballs and subscribers - I could ‚Äúbuild once, sell twice‚Äù.

Someone took the time to

visually transcribe

my podcast discussion on Twitter‚Äôs DM strategy and turned it into an asset that sparked hours of interesting debate. I commented in a writer‚Äôs group about the need for better idea / draft management capabilities as part of the publishing flow, and was pinged by a startup to participate in their UX research. I‚Äôve been asked to review a book on product-led CX. I‚Äôm doing a webinar later this month, and it took one back and forth in email to lock down the topic, because I already had the newsletter (both published articles and work-in-progress outlines) for the producers to choose from.

I only published 20 times in 2020, and it generated a ton of reach. I‚Äôm curious to see where else and how else I might find community if I publish weekly in 2021, or experiment with formatting, or try different writing styles, or test different distribution platforms.

Writing has opened doors, yes, but maybe I‚Äôm just more ready for doors to open because I‚Äôm in creation (vs consumption) mode. That sense of panic I would get when I had to do a talk or presentation or Q&A or panel or AMA, especially ad-hoc, is no longer there, because I feel like I‚Äôm always sharpening my thoughts. I think of myself less as a writer and more as a creator, whose foundation and fallback is writing, but who‚Äôs open to expressing ideas in whatever medium best conveys. And most importantly, I see a community developing with me, and that is extremely fulfilling.

So while I may have started this just to think things through and transition from consumption to creation, I‚Äôm going to continue it in 2021 as a way to connect.

11:47 PM ‚àô Jun 26, 2020

What I‚Äôd like to share today is the structured approach I‚Äôve been using build a readership; if you‚Äôve ever attempted to produce something of value, with quality, at scale, for an audience, this will resonate.

creation and distribution are distinct activities

collaboration is the only way to scale up and out

you have to experiment with different channels

user engagement prevents monotony setting in

an acquisition funnel requires time and/or money

quality takes investment and forces trade-offs

real value compounds and amplifies over time

Let‚Äôs walk through each of these dimensions in detail:

[1] Creation vs Distribution

I chose Substack as the platform for hosting this newsletter because it‚Äôs designed as a product for writers, and it let‚Äôs you evolve your audience as you see fit (free sign-ups, paid subscriptions). Having previously tried

Quora for blogging

and

LinkedIn for publishing

, I realized the former is interested in being a knowledge repository and the latter a professional network - both of those missions only tangentially intersect with an individual trying to produce content for a target audience, so my needs as a writer felt un-met.

While I‚Äôve been very happy with Substack as my home base for the distribution of my posts, I‚Äôve felt the need for a more purpose-built tool for ideating and iterating on ideas. I have > 100 draft articles on Substack, and while the web editor is full-featured and the mobile view is not lacking, I find myself wanting to sketch out ideas a bit before sitting down to finalize and publish. For now, I just use a notebook given

my Luddite tendencies

, but I‚Äôm strongly leaning towards Notion as my app of choice to formulate future posts and create a more coherent story arc. I‚Äôve also heard good things about

Coda

and

Roam

, but have yet to try them myself.

[2] Scale Through Collaboration

At some point you‚Äôll realize that you alone can‚Äôt produce enough content to sustain an audience. If you‚Äôre writing just for yourself as a way to clarify your thinking (this is how I started), then you‚Äôre fine; however, if folks find value in what you‚Äôre publishing and want more, you‚Äôll struggle to meet that need without a significant time commitment. If writing is a side project for you, there is a risk it‚Äôll fizzle out - you won‚Äôt create enough to get a feedback loop going, and that lack of positive reinforcement causes you to lose energy.

One way out of this conundrum is to stop trying to do it alone. If you work with others who are on a similar mission, there‚Äôs a support system in place. Some of the things I‚Äôve started to leverage are writing groups to share best practices, polling readers to brainstorm topics, and chatting on Twitter with writers who do it full-time. My next experiment is to co-author articles with very engaged readers, and eventually think about a newsletter bundle (one curated mega subscription vs ad-hoc individual streams).

[3] Channel Experimentation

One thing I believe in is

products are built to fit channels

. I‚Äôve gotten almost no traction with threads on Substack, but that format works nicely on Twitter. I‚Äôve published the same post on LinkedIn and Medium with a 10x difference in clickthrough - leveraging an existing audience is way easier than building a new one. Every channel has its idiosyncrasies, but how can you possibly produce content that‚Äôs optimized for each distribution method? I focus on the thoughtful Substack posts, and then slice and dice for other platforms: threads on Twitter, aphorisms on LinkedIn, etc. You also can stretch one article out several days given the pace of content cycling - it‚Äôs likely folks didn‚Äôt catch it in their feeds when you first posted, so you have to bump up multiple times and use other influencers to amplify (don‚Äôt hesitate to engage with subject matter experts in a dialogue around your idea).

The other thing I‚Äôve realized is that certain formats work better across publications. My

creative essays

do well on Substack, but certain

dense topics

are a bit much for an email newsletter. Eventually, audio and video have to come into play, in both snippets and long-form. On that front, I‚Äôve started to dabble in podcasts (coming soon!) and hope to get over my camera shyness before the end of the year. Lastly, there are simple teasers (like a Tweet) for your essays, and then there are indirect lead-ins like a Quora answer - I find the former is great for short-term traffic generation, while the latter helps with the long-tail.

[4] User Engagement

The most rewarding / most difficult aspect of writing is getting readers to engage. LinkedIn has been the best platform by far on this front, and that‚Äôs because the reach goes well beyond my 1st-degree network - posting something topical and trendy can get attention for several days in a row. Substack hasn‚Äôt been too strong a source of comments / favorites, and my current theory is that people read the email newsletter on their mobile devices, and clicking through to the website to respond is too much friction. I‚Äôve actually had people respond to the email, and it‚Äôs a strange sensation to have a thoughtful back and forth over email (vs in an app like Twitter).

Subscribing to other newsletters is actually a great way to observe how others are tackling this problem. One common technique, once you‚Äôve got enough of a content archive, is to send readers a ‚Äúbest of compilation‚Äù (usually at initial sign-up). Pictures are also great visual cues, which is why I‚Äôve actually kept up the

‚Äúchildish drawing / interpretation‚Äù

routine to end my posts; multiple readers have told it‚Äôs a memorable gimmick, and if you‚Äôre cross-posting on other platforms like LinkedIn / Twitter, images will boost click through rates significantly.

[5] Acquisition Strategy

The highest ROI strategy I‚Äôve utilized to get sign-ups has been direct outreach to prospective readers, usually via LinkedIn, but also email / Twitter. What I basically do here is identify ~ 5 people per week who I think would actually enjoy my writing and then reach out to them with a hand-crafted note. My criteria for reaching out to folks is either (a) they tend to be industry experts on the topic I‚Äôve written about or (b) I‚Äôve worked with them before in that sphere. The response rate is a heartwarmingly high 80%, and a meaningful 20% will go above and beyond with very constructive feedback.

The internal debate I‚Äôm still having on this front is nailing down my niche. Since I started writing for myself, the topics and style tend to meander, and the consistent feedback I‚Äôve received from professional writers and editors is to have an actual target reader persona in mind. My most popular most by far is

a collection of tips on public speaking

, and the broad appeal likely correlates to how well the article performed, but it‚Äôs hard to generate such mass market content on a regular basis - individual experiences just can‚Äôt be up-leveled and genericized to that degree. My next step here is to step a little outside my groove (product builders in tech) to see what adjacent reader bases there might be, and that might require actual acquisition spend (e.g. marketing campaigns) beyond elbow grease.

[6] Crafting Quality

By far the biggest mental hurdle to publishing (not writing, publishing) has been the voice in my head saying

‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt your best work‚Ä¶what would Mrs. D‚ÄôSouza from 7th grade Language Arts say?‚Äù

. To get over my initial hang-up and actually launch this newsletter, I ignored Mrs. D‚ÄôSouza. But quality matters. I can‚Äôt quantify it, but my ability to broadcast and amplify any article is a function of how crisp my writing (and thinking) on the topic was - when you know you‚Äôve got a great post, the distribution comes easy. The other thing I‚Äôve come to appreciate is that regular, interesting content beats all the other ‚Äúgrowth hacks‚Äù.

My approach so far has been to write regularly (literally every day start a new post or tweak a draft article) and publish when I run out of edits. My editing right now includes a lot of re-reading while writing and actually putting drafts aside for a day or so and coming back with fresh eyes. Ultimately, there is no substitute for an actual editor - I‚Äôve had folks message me pointing out simple typos and grammatical goofs - you just miss things when you‚Äôve been starting at it forever. Editing is its own craft, so a structured guide / automated tooling is actually a good investment on this front.

[7] Compounding Value

The last insight I‚Äôll offer is the compounding value of not only a good article, but also a growing collection of quality writing. An evergreen post you can leverage multiple times vs just at the initial publication. When the topic comes up organically, you can refer folks back to your write-up. I‚Äôve actually gone back and added new sections and additional references to existing articles when readers help me rethink things week / months down the line.

Additionally, once you hit a critical mass, a flywheel effect kicks in. For my first 2 months, I was doing direct outreach AND publishing 3-4 times a week to show a certain pace of content creation for new readers. But the last 1 month I‚Äôve only been posting 1-2 times a week AND barely been doing outreach, yet the pace of new sign-ups has actually accelerated. Since Substack lets me see what posts lead to new subscriptions, I‚Äôve noticed a pattern around older content actually generating leads. The idea of today‚Äôs output leading to tomorrow‚Äôs outcome is a

pet principle of mine

. Finally, once you have a compilation, you can open up other doors like traditional books, speaking engagements, and coaching opportunities.

Hopefully this playbook inspires others to switch from a consumer mindset to a producer ethos - I firmly believe after doing this for 90 days that writing is creating.

Writing is Iterating,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/writing-is-iterating,"I got an interesting question from a reader this weekend along the lines of ‚Äúhow do you find the time to write?‚Äù and I responded with this great Seth Godin quote:

‚ÄúThere is no good writing that wasn‚Äôt preceded by bad writing.‚Äù

My process is pretty straightforward at this point:

scribble some thoughts every day

just for a few minutes when an idea strikes

then either scribble new thoughts or iterate on an existing scribble

again, just a few minutes a day

whenever something feels like it‚Äôs worth a broader opinion

turn scribbles into a coherent draft post

and polish draft to publish if you find flow

most importantly, fight the urge to wait till it‚Äôs perfect

Writing is Thinking,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/writing-is-thinking,"For a long time, in my professional (and personal) life, I would

write without much purpose

. At work, I would take notes on everything, and then pore over them afterwards to try and synthesize some meaning from the discussions. It was a practice I picked up in middle school, when we had a visitor in my language arts class that did a whole session on proper note taking techniques. It became a habit in high school, a necessity in college, and a compulsion in my career. It became an essential part of how I

think

. And, just to acknowledge my biases, I began to form opinions on folks who couldn‚Äôt articulate their ideas in a clear written narrative - namely that they weren‚Äôt clear / deep thinkers.

When I joined the Kindle team (my first official PM gig) in 2010, I was immersed in the Amazon

n

-pager culture and got pulled into a real feedback loop on my writing. There is nothing like (occasional)

S-team eyeballs

to make you proofread and edit. And it wasn‚Äôt just press releases and requirements docs - the need to write crisply was felt in launch comms, website copy, status updates, interview notes, etc. During this period, I shifted my thinking, and began to see writing not as a pointless obsession but as a critical skill. Most (all?) of the meaningful work I‚Äôve done since then is rooted in clear thinking aided by a tight write-up. For example, the

Twitter Fail Whale discontinuation

traces back to my 3-pager on platform / infrastructure strategy for monolith decomposition and data center expansion (it was a riveting read, trust me).

So what is it about writing that helps sharpen ideas?

Steel Thread

- you‚Äôre forced to craft the ‚Äúspine of your narrative‚Äù, the key assumptions / conclusions, which you can counter-argue on logic / merit, to prepare yourself for an eventual review / dissection of the proposal

Talk Track

- you end up weaving in data points, customer quotes, anecdata, market research, etc which all serve as color commentary for the core idea, which is why it‚Äôs much easier to build a slide deck presentation based on an

n

-pager (doing it the other way, meaning selling before thinking, is harder to pull off)

Call to Action

- when you express something clearly enough, it puts the onus on all stakeholders to respond, either in support of moving forward or with a counter- argument / proposal (which helps further refine the pitch), so as long as you‚Äôre not over-indexed on pride of authorship, this is generally good for all

One of my favorite quotes on this topic:

‚ÄúNothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come.‚Äù - Victor Hugo

I have 2 takeaways from this:

no one will know the idea‚Äôs time has come unless someone writes it down

even if you write it down, it might not happen, because the timing isn‚Äôt right

So keep writing, to not only ideate, but also iterate. I look forward to reading your thoughts‚Ä¶

Your Actual Task List,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/your-actual-task-list,"ibrahim

@ibscribe

my inbox is not my todo list, my inbox is not my todo list...

2:32 PM ‚àô Apr 18, 2014

That Tweet is from 6+ years ago! And yet I, and I‚Äôm sure many others, still struggle with mistaking the inbox as the TODO list. And now we have multiple inboxes! The email inbox, the calendar notifications, the Slack messages - all independent, nagging, streaming reminders of work that needs to be done‚Ä¶or does it?

Who decided it needed to be done? Whether urgently or if at all, who decided it needed to be done? Who determined it was a priority?

There is one common thread between all the emails, invites, and messages: THEY DIDN‚ÄôT COME FROM YOU!

By internalizing the constant pressure to keep up with them, you are abdicating control of your task list and ultimately your ability to achieve flow. And that was the whole point of organizing your work to begin with - to produce meaningful outcomes and make an impact through focus, not to check things off as they come through for the illusion of progress and perception of productivity.

So how do you wrestle back control?

There is a longer set of tips I‚Äôll share in a future post about time management (which is the crux of being not only efficient but also effective), but today I‚Äôd like to walk through some TODO list management schemes I‚Äôve developed.

Focus Requires Time

- obvious, but before actually starting on any task it‚Äôs important to agree with yourself that it‚Äôs a task worthy of your time, that you uniquely are positioned to accomplish it, and it should be at the top of your list versus everything else on your plate‚Ä¶if any of that is not true, then you‚Äôre not really focusing‚Ä¶going off what others want you to do or some other urgency driver should not be your default!

Operating Horizons Matter

- we tend to add things to our TODO lists indiscriminately, and items that have different pay-off timelines (day, week, month, year, decade) tend to be judged equally; this has 2 side-effects: (1) we tend to pick the short-term stuff because it‚Äôs easier to finish and (2) the long-term stuff just piles up and starts to feel impossible‚Ä¶breaking down the long-term stuff is a good way to level the playing field, but also asking yourself what type of time horizon you want to operate on is also critical‚Ä¶operating on a daily cadence should not be your default!

Cognitive Load Distracts

- this one might just be me, but seeing everything on my TODO list at once, especially if it‚Äôs not getting crossed off at a reasonable pace, just becomes a mental burden, and I spiral on the length of the TODO list versus actually progressing on 1 thing at a time‚Ä¶my hack around this has been to move recurring items, upcoming TODOs, collaborative work to my calendar‚Ä¶schedule when to introduce latent tasks to your TODO list versus it being ever-present‚Ä¶being over-whelmed should not be your default!

Priorities Split Attention

- priorities as a word never made sense to me, it‚Äôs supposed to be priority‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not saying don‚Äôt prioritize your list, I‚Äôm saying a prioritized list has 1 thing at the top‚Ä¶and in order to actual prioritize, you have to do all of the things above (spend time, create focus, establish horizons, remove distractions)‚Ä¶multi-tasking should not be your default!

Waiting Isn‚Äôt Working

- how many things are on your task list right now that are waiting on something from someone? it should be none; anything that requires input from someone else should be a task on their list, an email, a meeting, etc‚Ä¶a well-groomed list is only things that you can execute on versus having to chase others‚Ä¶dependency management should be your default!

Cues Enable Context

- I love to use environment to put myself in the right state of mind to get things done‚Ä¶if you want to read more, keep the Kindle on your nightstand and plug in your phone out of reaching distance‚Ä¶I use this trick with my TODO list my creating separate Google Calendars for every family of tasks‚Ä¶so you could have a home remodel calendar that you make the default on weekends to get yourself focused on your renovation‚Ä¶.a consolidated view should not be your default!

Habits Need Nurturing

- finally, so much of focus is being intentional by building good habits, but these don‚Äôt happen over-night‚Ä¶I use time tracking, daily journaling, monthly retrospectives, and project post-mortems to figure out any systemic issues with the way I‚Äôm approaching my productivity goals‚Ä¶one of the traps I tend to fall into and the question I ask myself regularly is whether I‚Äôm being just efficient or truly effective‚Ä¶unintentional should not be your default!

Your IC Prime,https://runthebusiness.substack.com/p/your-ic-prime,"Transitioning to management is one of the more complex transitions you can make in your career, and I‚Äôve been thinking recently about the mindset shift required to pull it off successfully. Actually, I read about inversion (see references), and started thinking about what themes were common among ICs (individual contributors) that weren‚Äôt able to make it work as managers. One issue kept cropping up as I went over past colleagues who switched and stumbled: they thought they were still in their IC prime.

What is your IC prime? It‚Äôs a concept I made up, but basically think of it as the period in your career when you, as a directly responsible inidividual (DRI), had the most impact. As a PM it might be the biggest product you ever launched. As an engineer it might the most complex system you ever architected. As a salesperson it might be the biggest deal you ever closed. Basically, it‚Äôs the peak of your powers as an IC.

So what does this have to do with jumping into management? Well, the move is made harder if in your mind you still think you‚Äôre in your IC prime. It leads to several dysfunctions:

you default to showing people how you‚Äôd do it vs coaching people on how they could do it

you lack empathy for folks who may not have hit their IC prime or whose prime is not near yours

you get frustrated with having to repeatedly communicate what is obvious and intuitive to you

you assume that your playbook is the only formula for execution vs being open to other ways

So what does this mean for an IC considering management? Here are 3 key questions to ponder:

Do you think your IC prime has peaked / is on the decline?

Would you be fulfilled coaching others vs doing it yourself?

Can you learn the skills required to unlock others‚Äô IC primes?
