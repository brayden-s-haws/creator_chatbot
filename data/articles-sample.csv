"Getting Started with RAG Systems","https://example.com/rag-intro","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems represent a powerful approach to building AI applications that can respond with factually grounded information. Unlike pure Large Language Models (LLMs) that can only access information from their training data, RAG systems combine the strengths of retrieval systems with generative AI. The key components of a RAG system include: 1) A document store or knowledge base, 2) An embedding model to convert text to vectors, 3) A vector database for similarity search, and 4) An LLM to generate coherent responses. When a user query comes in, the system retrieves relevant documents from the knowledge base and provides them as context to the LLM, which then generates a response grounded in that specific information. This approach helps overcome hallucination problems common in pure generative models.",2025-02-01T09:00:00Z,rag-intro-2025
"Vector Embeddings Explained","https://example.com/vector-embeddings","Vector embeddings are numerical representations of text, images, or other data that capture semantic meaning in a way that machines can process. In natural language processing, embeddings map words or chunks of text to vectors in a high-dimensional space, where similar meanings are positioned close together. Modern embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small can represent complex documents in just 1536 dimensions while preserving remarkable semantic relationships. The process works by passing text through a neural network trained on vast corpora to predict contextual patterns. The resulting vectors enable powerful capabilities like semantic search, where we find documents based on meaning rather than keyword matching. When implementing embeddings in a RAG system, it's crucial to balance embedding granularity (chunk size) with computational efficiency and to properly normalize vectors for accurate similarity calculations.",2025-02-05T14:30:00Z,vector-embed-2025-feb
"Optimizing RAG Performance","https://example.com/rag-optimization","Improving RAG system performance requires attention to several key areas. First, document preprocessing and chunking strategies significantly impact retrieval quality - experiment with different chunk sizes and overlaps to find what works best for your domain. Second, embedding model selection matters; newer models like text-embedding-3-large offer better semantic understanding but at higher computational cost. Third, implement hybrid retrieval combining keyword and semantic search for improved recall. Fourth, add a reranking step after initial retrieval to better prioritize the most relevant documents before sending to the LLM. Finally, prompt engineering is critical - structure your prompts to effectively utilize the retrieved context and instruct the model on how to handle information gaps or uncertainties. Remember that RAG systems require continuous evaluation and refinement against user queries to achieve optimal performance.",2025-02-10T11:15:00Z,rag-opt-10022025
